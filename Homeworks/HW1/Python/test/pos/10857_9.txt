For every fan of coming of age tales  this 3 hour adaptation of the Sarah Waters novel is pure fun  Cinematic nods to Baz Luhrman's kinetic style  as well as to all those prim and proper period pieces ever present on the BBC  where you're likely to have seen almost every prominent member of this cast   It's rather bawdy and over the top in spots  but that's just what the novel called for  The cast is appealing and  in the cases of Anna Chancellor and Hugh Bonneville  perfect  In the case of Rachel Sterling  as our heroine Nan  you simply must overlook the fact that she's far too pretty to ever be mistaken for a boy and run with it  It's a fantasy  after all   Some fans of the novel may be put out by the various changes in character  particularly that of Jodhi May's character  Florence   but the changes all work toward the greater good of this teleplay and provide an overall high quality entertainment value
