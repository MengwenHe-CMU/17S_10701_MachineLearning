Maybe I'm reading into this too much  but I wonder how much of a hand Hongsheng had in developing the film  I mean  when a story is told casting the main character as himself  I would think he would be a heavy hand in writing  documenting  etc  and that would make it a little biased  But   his family and friends also may have had a hand in getting the actual details about Hongsheng's life  I think the best view would have been told from Hongsheng's family and friends' perspectives  They saw his transformation and weren't so messed up on drugs that they remember everything  As for Hongsheng being full of himself  the consistencies of the Jesus Christ pose make him appear as a martyr who sacrificed his life  metaphorically  of course  he's obviously still alive as he was cast as himself  for his family's happiness  Huh  The viewer sees him at his lowest points while still maintaining a superiority complex  He lies on the grass coming down from  during   a high by himself and with his father  he contemplates life and has visions of dragons at his window  he celebrates his freedom on a bicycle all while outstretching his arms  his head cocked to the side  It's fabulous that he's off of drugs now  but he's no hero  He went from a high point in his career in acting to his most vulnerable point while on drugs to come back somewhere in the middle  This same device is used in Ted Demme's  Blow  where the audience empathizes with the main character who is shown as a flawed hero  However   Quitting    Zuotian   is a film that is recommended  mostly for its haunting soundtrack  superb acting  and landscapes  But  the best part is the feeling that one gets when what we presume to be the house of Jia Hongsheng is actually a stage setting for a play  It makes the viewer feel as if Hongsheng's life was merely a play told in many difficult parts
