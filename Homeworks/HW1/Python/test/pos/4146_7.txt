Where do I start  Do I say how great the cinematography is  Do I praise certain scenes which show the directors creativity  Do I tell how realistic the scenes on Ellis Island are  Should I mention that for a change we do not have the clich   scene of viewing Statue Of Liberty   By now immigrants viewing the statue from the ships railing is a clich    Now whats not likable  two major things  one being a modern song score   not even a good one to boot  Second   nearly deadly the film is boring it moves so slow  that watching paint dry would be an improvement  The 118 minute running time is to long   yet the film seems unfinished  We see no scenes of this family in the US  Our hero mentions he wants to find his twin brother  I would have enjoyed scenes of his futile of maybe lucky search  instead of other drawn out scenes  The film is a near miss  Ratings      out of 4  81 points  out of 100  IMDb 7  out of 10
