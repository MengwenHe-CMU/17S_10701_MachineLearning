Watching this on Comcast On-Demand  Every time I see this musical  I am amazed at the songs   one show-stopper after another  This interpretation is  for me  magical  The songs sparkle   the vocals  orchestrations  and choreography are amazing for a  made-for-TV  movie   better than many stage versions I have seen  The debate over Bette just doesn't make sense  She is Mamma  Her voice is brilliant and yet full of the pathos of the stage mother living through her daughters  I still get tears at the end when she finally has her moment of glory  no matter how faded that glory is  The Tulsa Louise duet dance is on now  Fabulous  Stephen Sondheim is the King of musical theatre  His lyrics just roll off the tongue like silk   Styne's music is perhaps the best ever penned for the stage screen  Thank God we have this masterpiece of the American Musical Theatre captured on DVD
