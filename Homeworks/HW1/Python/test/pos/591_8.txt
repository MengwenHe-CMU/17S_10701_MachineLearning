The Muppet Movie  directed by  James Frawley Kermit the Frog and friends relive the tales and stories of how they all came together  The Muppets star in their first feature film  bringing the magic they are known for to a bigger picture  The story is not too complex and is written as a prequel of sorts  The well written jokes appear as each character gets a worthy introduction  The cameos aren't just thrown in either  but written in as interesting characters  making one of the many peaks for our furry friends
