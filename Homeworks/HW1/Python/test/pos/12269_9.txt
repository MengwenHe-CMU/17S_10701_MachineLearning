For me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings  Its about the tangled lives of three very different people  Holly Hunter is the obsessive workaholic producer  Albert Brookes plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist  William Hurt is the affable but dumb new kid on the block  news anchor  The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Brookes in love with Hunter but she of course is attracted to Hurt  This film works on many levels  At the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of ones that you may have missed last time  Its also a film about attraction and unfulfilled romance  But perhaps most importantly the film examines the modern obsession with physical appearance and its ultimate triumph over intellect as a valued human attribute  This is personified by the meteoric career success of the Hurt character in contrast to Brookes relative decline  Despite being fifteen years old the film has some startingly relevant messages about modern news values and the continuing decline in journalistic standards  This film is a classic in every sense and it is difficult to understand why it has been so neglected
