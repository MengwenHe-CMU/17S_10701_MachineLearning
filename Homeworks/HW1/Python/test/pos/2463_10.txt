One of my desires is to be a film-maker  and I just have to say there's no way I will be able to compete with the powerful drama The War at Home  The reason is because the acting is perfect  and when you see the movie  you'll know what I'm talking about  All I can suggest is watching it  I got so involved in it and was extremely impressed  Estevez's and Sheen's relationship on the screen was absolutely amazing  And so was his relationship with his mother  Kathy Bates   Some of the best scenes include these 2   As well as the relationship between Sheen and his daughter  Estevez's sister in the film  10 10  and definitely in my top 10  I want the DVD
