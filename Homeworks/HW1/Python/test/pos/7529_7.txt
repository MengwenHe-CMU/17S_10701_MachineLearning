Pepe Le Pew can either really creep you out or totally sweep you off your feet  Either way  you can't help feeling a little awe on beholding this classic WB character  This commentater personally believes that Pepe was the inspiration behind other would be animated casanovas today from Cartoon Network's  Johnny Bravo  to Disney's Lumiere from  Beauty and the Beast    His unique brand of love making is to be wondered at in today's world where his antics would normally be slapped with a sexual harassment warrant and at least a 50m distance from all his victims   In this particular cartoon  a world weary cat decides to do an ultimate makeover and earn some respect for a change for pretending to be a skunk  All goes well  until Pepe arrives and promptly pursues the unfortunate feline with his overwhelmingly enthusiastic love-making  The groundwork for Pepe's many trademarks are laid in this cartoon  From his adorable  frenchified  love calls to that aggravatingly calm hop-chase of his   This cartoon only goes to show that as far as the world of cartoon fantasy is concerned  the most ardent wooer can go the distance   and have his beloved  pig-eon  leaving dust trails behind them
