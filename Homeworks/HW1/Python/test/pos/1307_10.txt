This was a great movie  It had one  sot-so-nice  outburst  Plus there were some very intense  drama  scenes which might make it inappropriate for younger viewers  under 6  For a under the radar film  the acting was quite enjoyable  and touched down in our family room for a near perfect landing  It held the attention of our whole family and we were kind of sorry to see it end  This movie had elements of spy kids with young people saving the day  but was given a somewhat more believable scenario  The dream scenes were a distraction at first  but did a great deal to establish the plot  The pranks and hi-jinx were also quite amusing  We hope you like as much as we did
