    but I laughed  A lot  I saw 'Ast  rix et les Vikings' at a public screening during the World Cup  The sound was lousy  it was too bright to see the screen properly - but I still enjoyed myself immensely  The names of some of the characters had me rolling on the floor  Smsix  Abba  Vikea    All not very witty  but in good Ast  rix tradition  Some very good jokes  but also some that not everybody seemed to get  The only thing I didn't like were the voices of Ast  rix and Ob  lix  in the German version at least  The voice actors are very well-known around here  which was the only reason they were casted  really  They don't fit the characters at all  All in all  a good way to spend some time  and if it's free  like in my case  all the better  and to have a couple of laughs  8 out of 10
