Working the night shift in a seedy police station  stumbling through life in an alcoholic haze  Detective Mickey Hayden can hardly be said to have a firm grasp on reality to begin with  but when a bump on the head unleashes terrifying psychic visions  things get truly weird  Soon he's on the trail of a serial killer and unraveling the mystery of his beautiful first victim  the elusive Alice  The role of an embittered burn-out seems tailor-made for Keifer Sutherland and he makes the most of it  The plot's typical serial killer stuff  but it has enough quirks  twists  and genuine surprises to raise it above the usual genre fare and even make up for a painfully low budget   One wonders what this film could have been if there'd been money for a few more rewrites and a few more takes   All in all  'After Alice' is a pleasant diversion for anyone  but for fans of Lewis Carroll's 'Alice' books  it's a real treat  From the topsy-turvy reality in which things are rarely what they've seem  to more obvious references -- a killer called 'The Jabberwocky'  who leaves playing cards on his victims' bodies -- there's an 'Alice' reference at every turn  Below is a list of the ones I uncovered  Since finding them yourself is half the fun  I've marked them as spoilers  SPOILERS Cast of Characters Mickey - In a sense he's Alice himself wandering through strange landscapes  encountering odd characters  but Harvey  recognizing his true nature  identifies him as the hapless  bumbling White Knight   John Hatter  Mickey's boss  - Is he really 'mad'  You be the judge Claudette - An African-American transvestite  Obviously  the Black Queen Margaret Ellison - Mickey calls her the Red Queen  but her brutal nature suggests  more specifically  the Queen of Hearts  Gideon Wood - Suspected of being the Jabberwocky killer  his ambiguous role is more suggestive of a snark  or a boojum perhaps   Harvey - His role as unofficial guide to 'wonderland' and his name  evocative of another famous cinematic rabbit  makes me think he must be the White Rabbit Dr  Vera Swann - Her last name and relationship with Mickey suggest the White Queen  Other Connections Mickey's adventures begin when he chases a man in white and falls down a  rabbit  hole   Mickey drunkenly tells his cat to stop grinning at him  Cheshire Cat  The killer is revealed 'through the looking glass'  The climatic showdown ends in a swirl of playing cards  just as Alice's adventure did in the book  The statues in the garden look like giant chess pieces
