I'm not American  but Meatballs still really hits me  Maybe because it's a sweet  sweet movie  Watching it again today made me sentimental for a time I can't really put my finger on and a place I can't quite remember  Meatballs is just a great movie  It reminds me of innocent days when nothing really mattered and anything was possible  If you're reading this you probably know what I mean  All I can say on top of what I've already said is that Meatballs must be even more nostalgic if you're American  I guess you know what I mean by that too
