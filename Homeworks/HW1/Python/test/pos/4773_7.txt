    But it is also Minnie's and Pete's too  Yes  the grumpy captain may not look like Pete  but it is  Mickey and Minnie are the best characters  both of them are very sweet and likable  Interestingly  Minnie is more of a lady in this than what she usually is today and Mickey is less than considerate in this than he is now  Pete is still the same old meanie  but he looks a bit different   In this famous episode  on board a little steamboat  Mickey  Minnie and some side characters have a great deal of fun and a great deal of annoyances  Even in their first appearances  the three main characters are very developed   I quite like this episode  although overall I prefer the Mickey Mouse in the future  I like the animation  the steamboat and music theme  the clever gags - and of course  Mickey and Minnie   Like many early cartoons  this is very random  Walt came up with a very basic plot and just added gags to  gear  it along  There is also a parrot side character who is very annoying and rather unnecessary  These are the things I do not like about it   Another interesting thing about this episode  that a colour version has not been made for it  or if it has  I've never heard about it    Anyone who just enjoys Mickey Mouse and Disney will enjoy this
