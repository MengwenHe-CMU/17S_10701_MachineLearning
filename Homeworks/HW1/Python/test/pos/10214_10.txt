Featuring some amazing and wonderful characters  a new mythology  superbly designed and executed sets  Nightbreed is a great film  Sadly the lack of a well known lead actor lead to the film finding obscurity  Perhaps also the homosexuality of the director lead to the film being unwittingly censored by the white audience the film decries  None the less the film is a treasure of the monster movie superhero genre  A sequel featuring Highlander style flashbacks to different epochs in history would be interesting   Another idea would be the foundation of the new Midian  Perhaps in Texas somewhere or the swamps of Lousiana with crocodile men and a traveling freak circus
