So well made  no CGI crap  Has anyone else been on the  Jumping Crocs  tour of Darwin's Adelaide River before  Black Water was WAY realistic  Rogue was a bit cringeworthy  Thought the blonde chick was excellent in it - haven't really seen her before  And the other chick is a babe  she is always excellent   V  suspenseful - I would compare it to Jaws over any other man eating animal flick   Got the hole Aussie thing down pat without going OTT with struths and crikeys  as well   Loved it
