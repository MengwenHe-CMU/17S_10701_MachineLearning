Easily one of the best shows ever made    it just gets better with age  For me   one of the chief reasons for this was the English adaptation done by David Weir  A Japanese friend of mine once told me that the show in it's original language was more whimsical   less flat-out hilarious that the version we all know  The fact that the show resonates so strongly for its non-Japanese fans is   I think  largely because of Mr Weir's inspired efforts   some winning voice-over work  Well done  sir
