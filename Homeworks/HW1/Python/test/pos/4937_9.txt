Over the years some of them most enjoyable films have been about dysfunctional families  Bonjour Monsieur Sholmi is such a film This is an Isreali film about a Moroccan Jewish family  This could be about any family  in any culture  We all know or would want to know people like those in this comic gem  This 2003 delight was written   directed by Shemi Zorkin  Let us hope he a long career  The movie is seen through the eyes of the 16 year old son who seems to be concerned with everyone in the family  Heis brilliantly played by Oshri Cohen  he was 18 when he made the movie  He has been in a few since   I know I will hunt them up  Hopefully this young man will become an international star  The entire cast is magnificent I do hope I see them again  I loved every person in the cast to some degree I think all who see this will agree  It has been nominated for many international awards   has won 8  It deserved every one  Now being a film in a language besides English it had a very limited run in the USA  which I feel is regrettable  Rent this film you will be glad you did  Ratings     1 2  out of 4  95 points out of 100  IMDb 9  out of 10  NOTE  Since the story is not new  this is as high a rating it can get
