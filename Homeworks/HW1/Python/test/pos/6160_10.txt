Nothing short of magnificent photography cinematography in this film  The fact that you keep seeking and hoping for more flying sequences  tells you that they have just enough  The acting is fantastic  the stories are seamlessly woven together  and the dogs are splendid              A must rent  view  or see  Don't be afraid of subtitles         its worth a little aversion therapy 10 10
