i am an avid ff7 fan  for instance i have the game then sell it bad mistake  but then buy it again  good mistake   erm  anyways  yes this film is very good  the fights are very cool  music very good  and the cgi you cant falter  only thing disappointing with the film i felt was the lack of other character involvement  it was almost all cloud which although is a great character  u cant beat a of cid and barret  but despite that the film was great in my opinion  and a must watch  overall a great film give and will give it 9 10  squaresoft  make more films like this and you'll be worshiped more so than you already are
