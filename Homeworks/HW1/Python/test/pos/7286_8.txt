It's become extremely difficult to find a good horror movie anymore  thought this movie was a good thriller  Could have had better production values but what kept me going was the suspense and the twists  I had real reservations before seeing this movie  because of the cover   I was afraid that it would be excessively bloody and gory  I was wrong  Although there is a lot of scary parts  there is a lot of suspense and drama too  The acting in Dead Line was better than what you would expect from a micro budget horror flick  The characters were believable The movie is really thrilling and quite scary at moments so it makes you grab your seat until the ending credits roll Because of its production values  the sound is not very good for example  8 10
