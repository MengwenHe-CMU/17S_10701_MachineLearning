Mr Bean was great fun  i loved it  every episode was really funny  Rowan Atkinson was perfect for this role  he's a funny looking bloke and his facial expressions were hilarious     The series was so successful that they even made a Mr Bean movie in 1997  which was also pretty funny by the way    It's funny seeing all the adventures and situations he gets himself into  this series was a classic for sure  and i still watch an episode from time to time  Mr Bean is well worth a 10 10 in my book  fans of offbeat comedy must check this out
