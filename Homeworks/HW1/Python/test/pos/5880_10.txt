I was blown away when I saw  The Best Years of Our Lives   The acting  script  and Master William Wyler's Direction winner of Best Director in 1946 is Brilliant  This film is about three WWII veterans who come home from the war and are reunited with their loved ones  but have to deal with the hardships of coming home from the war  The first man Al Stephenson Played by Fredric March in his Oscar winning role  comes home to find his wife Millie played by Myrna Loy  and children Peggy and Rob played by Teresa Wright and Michael Hall  are more grown up and different than before he left for the war  The second man Fred Derry played by Dana Andrews  has to find a good job and come home to a wife he had only been married to 20 days before he left for the war  He begins to find out that she is not the same  Homer Parish played by Harold Russell in his Oscar winning role has lost his hands in the war and must deal with his family's and fiance' Wilma's played by Cathy O'Donnell  reactions to the hooks he has instead of his hands  All of these men and their families are reunited in the film in different scenes  The stories of these men are all interwoven beautifully together  This film truly defines the meaning of a  Classic   This unforgettable drama winner of best picture in 1946  is a film that everyone should see  If I was asked to pick a favorite film this would be it  Out of 10 I would give  The Best Years of Our Lives  An 10  So next time you go to your local video store rent this movie you won't regret it  NO objectionable material a good family film
