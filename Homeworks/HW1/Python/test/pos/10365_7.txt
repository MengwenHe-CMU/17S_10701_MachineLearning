This production was quite good  The usual fabulous scenery  interesting  quirky characters  It was just so strange not to have Captain Hastings  Miss Lemon  and Poirot's office residence  so prominently featured in the original PBS BBC mysteries  In the original series  so much took place at the office  Hastings reading the paper  while Poirot  exercises his little gray cells   Miss Lemon pitching in whenever needed  Poirot without Capt  Hastings would be like Holmes without Watson     he can most certainly solve the crime  but it is not as interesting  And what would a Poirot mystery be without Hastings  with his impeccable manners  falling for some beautiful  unattainable woman
