I saw this today with little background on what to expect of the storyline  I go to the movies as an escape  to leave everything behind and enjoy a  story   I found this to be a good movie  not great  but good  It was worth my money and my tears    Diane Lane was wonderful as always  Richard Gere isn't an over-actor  He held his own and has a certain presence that we always come to expect  He brings his own style to the movie  I think it was the kind of love story that doesn't always get told  It was messy and they had other priorities  but they wanted to be together and wanted to wait for each other  I'd definitely recommend it
