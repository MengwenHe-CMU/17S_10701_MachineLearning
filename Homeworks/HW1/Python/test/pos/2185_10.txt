George Hearn really went all out and over the top which in this case was great  I've heard the Len Cariou version but it was too tame  George was great in that character - very expressive  Angela Lansbury was perfect for the part  She gave a great performance  She gave the Mrs  Lovett a great devious and comical personality which balanced out the dark story  I love the dark humor when Angela Lansbury sings her songs as well as her physical expressions and the angry emotions of George Hearn in his songs of rage  vengeance and distress  I've watched this play 20 times since 1985 when I saw it on PBS  I bought it on video  after copying it in 1985 on my own when it came out in 1990 and I definitely bought a copy of the DVD when it came out in 2004
