I knew nothing about this film until I watched it    my brother in fact suggested I take a look  Normally  his suggestions aren't much cop however  but I was stuck for something to watch so I watched it  Well  to cut a long story short  I give it 10 10  The film centers around two people  that meet whilst lodging at the same place  One is initially very dependant upon the institution around him  the other is a rebel  One does what he likes  the other as he's told  From the first moments of the film we quickly see the friendship between the two building  and see how they rub off a little on each other  It's a remarkable piece of work  that manages to tell a good story without twist upon twist  people leaping out of bath tubs  or superheros coming to save the day  There's a fair amount of grit and reality in there  not everything can ever go just right - not all gulfs can ever be spanned - and this film delightfully shows the lot  If you watch this film  and are not impressed      I'd suggest that you don't watch anything again
