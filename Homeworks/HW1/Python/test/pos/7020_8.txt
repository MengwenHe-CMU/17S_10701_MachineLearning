Dirty Dancing - I think everyone has seen this movie at one time or another  I can remember as a kid I loved this movie and watched it over and over again without tiring of it  Now that I'm a little older  I bought the DVD recently and STILL wasn't disappointed with the performance  Swayze and Grey create the atmosphere for this movie  even though it's claimed they don't get along  the chemistry in the movie is unbelievable  As the movie proceeds  we are sucked into their relationship  and believe every single one of their actions   The soundtrack is amazing  the music only adds to the romantic mood of the movie and adds to the relationship between Baby   Patrick  The last scene makes this movie  who can ever forget the famous line  Noboby puts Baby in the corner   The song is perfect and the dancing is amazing   I would recommend this movie to anyone  at any age  it's just a fun movie anyone can enjoy 8 10
