this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity  truth  fun  talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC   from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best  if i hadn't have known better  i would have thought there was an elaborate script here  what you get  a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it's own entity  peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately  the rest of the cast is also phenomenal  there are no small parts        only small actors  and everyone involved here should be patted on the back  taken out to dinner and be considered for an Oscar  well done
