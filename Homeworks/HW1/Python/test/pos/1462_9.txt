A spin off comedy talk show from the creators of 'Garth Marenghi's Darkplace' The new series  Man to Man with Dean Learner  focuses on Garth's manager  publisher and publicity agent  as played by Richard Ayoade  Nightclub owner  restaurateur  publisher  international playboy - Dean Learner is a one-man brand   After his co-funded Channel 4 television hit Garth Marenghi's Darkplace he now invites you into his luxury penthouse flat for an all-new  entertaining and immensely stylish TV talk show  Man to Man with Dean Learner will feature all Dean's remaining celebrity friends  as well as plenty of live music and fine fish-dish cuisine in a show that reeks of class - but not fish  I attended two of the live recordings and it had me in stitches  There are distinct comparisons to Alan Partridge's 'Knowing me Knowing you' in the layout but Richard Ayoade and Matt Holness's unique writing style take it to another level  If your a fan of Darkplace then you can't miss it  Catch it when its aired late this summer
