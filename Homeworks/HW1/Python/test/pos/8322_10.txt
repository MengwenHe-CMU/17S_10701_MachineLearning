As John Grierson pointed out   The documentary genre can be defined like this  the creative interpretation of reality  This fabulous 180-minute documentary marks the first time a computer-generated project about dinosaurs respects the intelligence of the viewer  When I saw Jurassic Park  which I was expecting with great excitement  I was left extremely disappointed  Of course the dinosaurs were great  but the story-telling was unnecessary  I thought   What if they made a documentary on dinosaurs  with no crying children or bad puns  just dinosaurs made as realistic as possible  to let us marvel at what was once reality   My dream came true  The BBC has produced an exhilarating documentary exploring the different eras of the dinosaurs  This part is to all the people that seem to disagree with the fact that they had to guess at many points concerning the behavior  skin patterns etc  Of course they have to  Nobody was there  I think it is fantastic that they could present something as realistic as that  The guessings are all based on the knowings of many paleontologists  and it allows the viewer to have a pretty good idea of what it was like  If you wanna stick to what we know for sure  then just go visit a dinosaur bones museum  That is why I incorporated the Grierson quote at the beginning of this comment  Anyway  hats off to the creators of it
