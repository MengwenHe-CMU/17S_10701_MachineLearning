I recently purchased this on DVD as I hadn't heard of it and like robert carlyle  Obviously this movie is not going to have Hollywood blockbuster special effects in saying that though the special effects were decent enough and the acting was fine also  I found the movie to be enjoyable and do not regret buying it at all at almost 2 hours long it is just the right length for this type of movie  Do not expect thrilling explosive action from beginning to end though it is a fairly well balanced movie with a decent enough storyline
