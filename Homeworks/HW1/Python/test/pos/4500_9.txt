This is a film that left me breathless         wanting to learn more of the Afghan history and traditions  With todays  evil doer  mantra clouding reality  it was inspirational to experience the beauty of the people and their beliefs  Casting was impeccable  the scenery simply marvelous  The acting was first rate and the fact that the Academy overlooked this  except it's music  is unforgivable  The script is wonderful and such and emotional journey  Provoking an  ugly cry  from this watcher  A film worth watching a second and third time
