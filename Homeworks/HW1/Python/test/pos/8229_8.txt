I read ashew's comment and thought they must have been watching an entirely different picture   I just watched the film this morning and was quite surprised  To address ashew's comments  Trail Street is a very well done western  And Randolph Scott was in it quite a bit   Gabby Hayes was funnier than I've ever seen him   The bad guys had very good comeuppances as far as I was concerned  Plus  It was interesting to see Robert Ryan as a straight-laced good guy - he's usually so slimy  In all  a good western  very well acted and written  I liked the background story of Kansas and the  winter wheat  that supposedly helped it become a state  too  I thought the girl who played Susan was lovely - can't think why she didn't become a bigger star
