If you don't mind subtitles  you like comedy and truly interesting characters  along with a taste of something different from mainstream American cinema  then take a chance and rent this film  Two contrasting friends   one very neurotic sweater  the other the strong quiet loner type  working for a jerk butcher in a smaller danish town  decide to strike out on they're own together and open a butcher shop themselves  Not successful at first they incorporate something new to they're recipe and become an instant hit with the village  That being an interesting story in itself  this smartly humorous film is laced with even more   friendship  romance  crime  death  personal tragedy  that makes this film so funny yet riddled with numerous subtle interests that make it so interestingly funny yet warm and fuzzy  A must mention is the characters created and the actors making them believable  You can have the best script yet if the characters aren't believable it can sink a film and with this  the directing  acting  character believability and story all mesh so well they make this a very entertaining film  So  if your in the mood to stretch a lil  want to see something very good yet done a bit differently  then I suggest you rent this film while I'm on my way out to find more by director writer Anders Thomas Jensen
