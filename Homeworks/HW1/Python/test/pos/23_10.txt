Anyone who appreciates fine acting and ringing dialogue will love this film  Taken from Ronald 'Taking Sides' Harwood  it's a funny and ultimately excoriating analysis of a relationship between two very 'actorly' types  Albert Finney is sublime as the despotic Shakespearean actor who barely notices the world war raging around him  so intent is he on the crumbling fortunes of his theatre company and his own psychological and emotional breakdown  Tom Courtenay is matchless as Norman  the 'Dresser' of the title  whose apparent devotion turns out to be anything but selfless  Really a must see
