It's really not worthy of a 'best picture' consideration  but as entertainment goes  it does the job  This is one that I've watched  with pulse quickening every time  at least a dozen times  Most of these actors were unknown at the time this was done  and we can recognize them from other work  Those that don't have current name recognition probably don't want it  This was a fun ADVENTURE  Sort of like The Little Rascals if they just had to be serious
