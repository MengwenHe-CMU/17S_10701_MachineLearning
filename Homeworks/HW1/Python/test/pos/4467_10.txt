This is Lucio Fulci at his best  If only all the films he made after were like this  This extraordinary film is as intriguing as Dario Argento  s  The bird with crystal plumage      If you  re an Argento fan but you don  t like Lucio Fulci films  like  The Beyond    Manhattan Baby    The House by the Cemetery   etc  this one has nothing to do with the others    this is what the Italians call  giallo     that would be something like a  who-done-it  movie in a nutshell  You won  t know who the killer is until the last moments of the film  But apart from that  there  s the plot  some maniac living in a small village starts killing little boys    A journalist  Tomas Milian   a sexy young woman  Barbara Bouchet   a priest  Marc Porel   his mother  Irene Papas  and a witch  Florinda Bolkan  are the main characters in this tangled  bloody story  Talking about the actors  I want to say that Tomas Milian is superb  like always   and Florinda Bolkan is terrific as the village witch    Do you want to know who is the killer      I cannot tell you    but I can tell you that you must see this film    10 out of 10     of course
