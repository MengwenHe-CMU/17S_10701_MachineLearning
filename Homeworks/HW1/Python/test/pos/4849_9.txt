MPAA Rating PG-13 My Rating  10 and up My   Rating 9 5 10 William H  Macy delivers a stunning performance as the role of Mr  Neuman  He makes you feel sympathetic and scared for him simultaniously  The story starts out as a comedy and slowly but steadily becomes almost like a horror film with twists and turns that Macy effortly masters  I couldn't take my eyes off this film even after it ended  and I couldn't beleive it ended when it did  A MUST TO SEE  THIS PARAGRAPH MAY BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER BY SOME After you watch the film  look at the plot this way  The Neumans are the United States as a whole  and the charactor Meat Loaf Aday plays is the people in the United States who are anti-Semetic  This was a very enjoyable film and would reccomend to anyone I saw in the street
