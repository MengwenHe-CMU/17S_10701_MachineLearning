How on earth this film isn't more widely regarded is beyond me  I picked it up for   1  and I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best pound I've ever spent on a film  The thing that usually lets films about the club scene down is either the music or the actual scenes filmed in clubland  Here  the music and club scenes are completely credible using some big tunes of the time  and filmed in real clubs  with people actually looking like they want to be there  The performances from the actors are of a high standard all round  although Jason Donovan in particular for me stands out  he was playing Frank N Furter in The Rocky Horror Show in London at roughly the time this must have been filming  so his drag phase was in full flow    and of course Tim Curry who's eloquent drug land boss is convincing  Simply put  if you're a fan of British film you have to see this  it matters not a jot if you're into clubbing as the film is strong enough as a story anyway  Highly recommended
