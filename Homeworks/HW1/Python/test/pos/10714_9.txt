What can I say about Kramer vs  Kramer  On the surface it's rather simple but underneath it deals with emotions greater than life itself  It delivers many fantastic moments  it makes you laugh  it makes you cry  You sympathize with the characters and you care about them  Many films fail at this  Kramer vs  Kramer is a success  I think everyone would agree the acting is superb  Once you watch Kramer vs  Kramer  for some time the acting in most other films starts to feel plastic and unemotional  The actors seem to get along well with their roles and the characters really live on the screen  There's some beautiful chemistry between them  I think the best performance in the film comes from the young Justin Henry  He's different from any other child actor I've ever seen  He's amazingly natural  Also  there's some kind of neurotic beauty in Meryl Streep  And Dustin Hoffman delivers one of the best performances of his career  The story is very well written  It's simple but complicated at the same time  The concept is the simple part  the feelings associated is the complicated part of it  If you haven't seen this film yet  you're definitely missing out  See it now
