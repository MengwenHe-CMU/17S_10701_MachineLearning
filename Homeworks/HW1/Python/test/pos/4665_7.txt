As a movie  THE ITALIAN JOB is ok at best  good  not great  acting  nice visuals and pacing  a mediocre plot  but nothing bad enough to walk out on  But as a car commercial for the new breed of MINI Coopers  this film is spectacular   SPOILERS  Ok  it's a typical heist film with the odd twist  the underwater safe- cracking was nice  if not improbable   and the cast was fairly solid  with the exception of a putrid Wahlberg   but when it all came down to it  the real  stars  of this picture were the three MINI Coopers  in all their high-flying  speed-racing  ramp-jumping  bullet-taking  gold-lugging  shiny new glory  The audience I was sitting amongst actually  ooed  and  aahed  when Theron's little red number first hit the screen  strangely enough  neither she nor Wahlberg garnered the same reaction   The film starts out promising  Mos Def  Seth Green  Donald Sutherland  Edward Norton and Jason Statham all begin as an interesting and humourous band of characters  with the only real uninspired performance being that of the usually good Mark Wahlberg  Why he claims this is his best film I can't imagine  his character is completely one-note  and he plays him so blandly it was as if Mr  Rogers came back from the dead and was inhabiting his body  Charlize is fine as Sutherland's daughter  though nothing magical  Seth Green's character is perfect and the running Napster jokes  including a cameo by Napster founder  Shawn Fanning  are hilarious  he and some of Mos Def's early lines add some much needed sparks of humour  Unfortunately  Edward Norton and Donald Sutherland don't get near enough screen time  You can see most of the plot coming from a mile away  and the dialogue is rife with bad one-liners and give-aways  but I doubt the filmmakers were out to re-invent the wheel here  so taken as a typical action suspense flick it comes out alright  Worth seeing on cheap night I'd recommend  7 10  Not worth it's weight in gold  but makes for nice fillings
