Bonny Hunt scores a coup with her directorial debut  Minnie Driver and David Duchovny have that indescribable something called chemistry  Sure the plot is unlikely  but that doesn't stop one from enjoying this film  Carroll O'Conner does a great job as Grace's grandfather  Other great character actors play his card buddies  Jim Belushi is hilarious as the down-to-earth husband of Megan  part of the extended family  Faith  family  and marriage are respected  A few sexual references and salty words are used but in context and with gentle humor   And in the background that wonderful Dean Martin tune-- Return to Me   Recommended
