There have been approximately 60 different films   Television plays besides the classic Opera of this tale of a sex mad girl and her hapless soldier lover  This story has been done so many times  in various ways  Vicente Aranda directs Joaquin Jorda's screenplay adaptation of Prosper Merimee's classic novel   play  This is the story ONLY of Bizet's opera Carmen Pas Vega is an exciting Carmen full of passion   the ability to drive simple men to do terrible tragic things  Leonardo Sbaraglio is the hapless soldier who is ensnared into Carmen's poisonous web   led to doing bad things  Jay Benedict is the author Prosper who tells this tale  There is not much action  BUT there are some very hot sex scenes  In fact this is almost an NC-17 film  since I have seen this tale so often in so many guises I was not overly impressed  It is a very well made film   will be of interest to those that may not know of it  My not overly enthusiastic review also could be that I miss the fantastic Opera score by Bizet  See this as you may like it more than I did  Ratings      out of 4  82 points  out of 100  IMDb 7  out of 10
