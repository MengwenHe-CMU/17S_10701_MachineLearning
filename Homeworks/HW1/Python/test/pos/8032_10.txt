2002's the Bourne Identity is one of my all-time favorite movies  however  many fans of the book have complained that the movie had very little to do with the book's plot  The Assignment is the real deal  It's odd that no-one on the  Bourne Identity  threads has mentioned this movie at all   Well  I jst did   Besides the excellent plot  I personally found this movie to be as good as any espionage movie I've ever seen  with the possible exception of The Bourne Identity itself  The action is all completely realistic  I especially liked the protagonists' training regimen  which was very inventive  The feel is dark and gritty  There are a few surprising plot twists  The acting is excellent   If you like this genre  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough
