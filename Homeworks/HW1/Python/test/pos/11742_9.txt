The beautifully engaging song with the same name as the film won the best song Oscar in 1955  Love is a many splendored thing  It's the April rose that only grows in the early spring  Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  That golden crown that makes a man a king  Once on a high and windy hill In the morning mist two lovers kissed and the world stood still  Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  Yes  true love a many-splendored thing  How can we forget such a beautiful song  Henry King  the director  had the privilege to work with Jennifer Jones twice that year for this film and the greatly under-rated film  Good Morning  Miss Dove   Jones was nominated for  Splendored Thing  but she could have been easily nominated for Miss Dove as well  William Holden is just great as the war correspondent sent to report on the Communist revolution in 1949 China  His love for Jones  an oriental doctor  was endearing and so memorable to watch  While the ending is not pleasing  this is still one of the greatest romances ever put on the screen
