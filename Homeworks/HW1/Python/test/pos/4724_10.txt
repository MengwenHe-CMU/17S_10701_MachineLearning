Never had I seen such a powerful true story movie  I discovered a city  a country  a lost revolution and even a Nobel prize winner thanks to this masterpiece of cinema  If you haven't seen this movie  you can't say you've seen anything   A great lesson of courage  humility and life  I haven't seen anything as good since  T E  Saturday  January 9th  1999
