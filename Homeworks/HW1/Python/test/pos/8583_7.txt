The English are a little too evil  the Scots are a bit too heroic  The dialogue is overly dramatic at times  and the transitions between scenes could be smoother  Still   The Bruce  has the feel of authentic  if unpolished  history     even if it does play loosely with some important facts  Sandy Welch is no Gibson or Branagh  but he makes a stalwart Bruce  And Brian Blessed chews the scenery in delightful villainy as Edward I  While lacking the budget needed to make the final battle truly impressive  they still marshalled an impressive crowd for the English and Scottish armies  It is  according to filmmakers  the  largest filmed reconstruction of medieval battle ever staged in the British Isles   Allowing for a few failings and shortcomings  the film still does a convincing portrayal
