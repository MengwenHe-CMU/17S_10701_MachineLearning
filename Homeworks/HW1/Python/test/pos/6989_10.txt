Oh my gosh  this was one of the best Sci-fi movies i have ever seen  and quite frankly i can't stand Sci-fi films  Vin Diesel and his co-workers made this movie really enjoyable   I also must say that Vin diesel is by far the most sexiest and most talented male actors i have seen  Keep it up Vin  your doing great   As for everyone else good job  i thought the drama and suspense kept the viewers really intrigued  again  great job everyone and i 'm rooting for you Vin  Sincerely yours   Alexandra
