Even for the non-opera loving public the name CARMEN is immediately recognized as an opera by Bizet about a gypsy girl whose capricious loves destroy men  But as much as the opera is now considered a staple in every opera house repertoire  the real story of the wild gypsy lass as created by Prosper M  rim  e in 1845 has never been told as well as in this cinematic version by the abundantly gifted Spanish director Vicente Aranda  'Juana la Loca AKA Mad Love' 'Amantes'  'If they tell you I fell'  etc    Incorporating the author of the novel as a main character seeking the story of Carmen from one of her lovers - Jos   - provides just the right vantage for the story of this famous gypsy wild lady to be told   Carmen  the amazingly beautiful and talented Paz Vega  works in a cigar factory in Seville  a factory adjoining the military station where the very proper Jos    Leonardo Sbaraglia  is stationed  Carmen is tempestuous and in a fight instigated by a fellow factory worker bringing attention to the fact that Carmen is a gypsy  Carmen murders the co-worker and is arrested  Jos   is physically attracted to the voluptuous Carmen and when Carmen flirts with him he consents to allow her to escape - his payback is the promise for a night of passion with Carmen  Carmen keeps her pact  providing Jos   with his first sexual encounter  and Jos   is doomed  His lack of military discipline results in his losing his rank and being imprisoned for a while  but at his release Jos   encounters Carmen again  kills a fellow officer  and in fear runs off to the hills to live with the smugglers and gypsies that are Carmen's people  Many incidents occur to try the passionate bond between the lovers  but when Carmen's real husband is released from prison  destructive behaviors take over  behavior's that include Carmen's infatuation and affair with a bullfighter and the passion of Carmen and Jos   comes to a tragic end   One factor that makes the story  as adapted for the screen by director Aranda and Joaquim Jord   move so well is the role that Prosper M  rim  e  Jay Benedict  plays  his questioning of Jos   completes the story that Bizet's opera only outlines  The acting is superb  the cinematography by Paco Femenia and the excellent musical score by Jos   Nieto contribute enormously to the success of this very fine film  This is a must for lovers of the opera Carmen  and a splendid action drama for those viewers who admire historical pieces  Highly recommended  Grady Harp
