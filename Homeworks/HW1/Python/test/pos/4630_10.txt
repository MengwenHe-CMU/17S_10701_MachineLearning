I think this film has to be one of the most moving  and heartbreaking films of recent times  The film basically starts off with a suicide in a school toilet  U don't see who it is  then from there it goes to the beginning of the day  and we get to know 6 characters  and they are going through some pretty heavy things  anyway eventually one of them will commit suicide  I've been teaching Physical Education in schools for 8 years now  and never in a film have I seen such an accurate portrayal of what 'really' goes on in school life  The film is shot beautifully  and sounds incredible  The ending is so shocking  and so what one would not expect  it is something that will haunt me for days to come   This is Definitely one to watch  I think the fact that the Director Writer was in school only a few years ago is a major contributing factor to the raw honesty expressed in the film   The film is shot in two separate 'modes' if you will  Firstly there is the smooth observation style where we get to know the characters in their school environment as they go through their drama  but the stunning part of the film is in the interview sections  where we get to know the characters back stories  and their deepest  darkest thoughts  You keep wondering  who is it going to be  who commits suicide  and as the drama unfolds you keep changing your mind  until bam  it hits you in the face in the final five minutes  I am all over the place in my writing  but I've just seen it at a Media screening in Australia  and I am still in a bit of shock   It's one of the best Australian Films I have seen in recent years
