I saw this drama by cable TV  Although I saw just two series  I love this drama  I'm waiting for more series will be aired by cable  Even though it describes horrible  absurd situation in a prisoner's camp  this one shows us an indomitable spirit  warmth  friendship and humanity  They don't know whether they can survive or not  but kept their hope strongly without being discouraged by adversity  I know this movie is not realistic like other war documentary  but I don't want to blame for it  It makes me believe the strong will of people in the most difficult situation   'Private Bill'   especially  this episode touched deep in my heart  I remember every scene  I always hate mathematics  But after seeing this drama  I can understand something about mathematics    Mathematics is his connection between past and present  also symbolizes eternity  'Time  light and memory framed in a circle ' Like other victims of war  he lost his lover by irresistible fate  I'm immersed in his time and memory as if I experienced same thing  He experienced the great loss but he has pure passion of study  He started his study in the camp  his joy of realize  I believe his dedication of study sustained him  I saw it several times  but the meaning of this film never faded  Every time I saw it  I feel same deep emotion    Their songs are beautiful  harmonious  I'm sorry that I can't listen OST
