Like classic Hollywood musicals  the plot is just an excuse  A must see for those interested in French music hall  including a song by   dith Piaf  and for the wonderful 10 plus minute cancan finale  The dancing in the film is not at all like what usually passes for cancan  Some might object to the Technicolor costumes and the bright lighting  but it gives you a clear view of some grand costumes and sets  Consider it Jean Renoir's love letter to the Paris he grew up in  Certainly the Jean Renoir film for people who don't like his serious films or who only like his Hollywood productions
