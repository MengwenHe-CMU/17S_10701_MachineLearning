Being advertised as the most expensive movie ever made in the Czech Republic  it automatically makes the you think it will be over glorified and clich  d  out of fear of the budget   However with a budget of 8 Million and half the movie in English it was not exactly a big budget  high risk movie  What we have a grand epic tale centered around the friendship of two people  the younger Karel and the older Frantisek   As pilots in the Czech air force when the Germans invade before the beginning of world war II they escape the country to England to joined the RAF  Their friendship becomes strained through the love of the same woman  However there is a bond of friendship that goes beyond merely being friendly  Their friendship is an elegant metaphor for the attitude of the Czech people and their country  Remember they were not the winners  the defeated the Germans only to be invaded by the Russians  Funny  exciting  intriguing  beautiful  sad and illuminating this movie is one of my favourite war movies  Most of all I like the way they make fun of the British in a way that is amazingly affectionate and gives an amazing insight into the way the British military fought WWII  Forget the recent American efforts  Peal Harbour  Saving Private Ryan   this is the best WWII movie for a long time
