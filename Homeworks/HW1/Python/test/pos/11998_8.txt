This is  without a doubt  one of my favorite Columbo episodes ever  The acting is very well done  the music is very catchy  the script is ingenious  and the direction is fabulous  Peter Falk  who acts brilliantly in every Columbo episodes  acts particularly well in this episode  Also  great performances from Stephen Caffrey  Gary Hershberger  Alan Fudge and Robert Culp  The ending is absolutely brilliant and I love the way Columbo describes it  This is a Columbo movie that WON'T  go amiss
