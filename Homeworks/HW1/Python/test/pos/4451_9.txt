This film shows a serious side to the often thought of as gore-fest works of fulci  Not a lot of blood and guts here   but a fine tale about murder and the lives affected by it  A real find  considering it was made in 1972 and will soon celebrate its 30th anniversary  Check this one out  but be warned it is hard to find  Ron
