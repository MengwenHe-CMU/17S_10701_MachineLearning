America's next top model is a good show  it helps people with their careers  but lately i have become bored with it  cycle 1  yeah I'm happy Adrienne won  i wanted her to win from the beginning  cycle 2  its too bad  i think Mercedes deserved it  cycle 3  i did not like Eva  but i did not like most of the girls in this cycle  cycle 4  Kahlen should have won  i don't know what they saw in Naima  but i definitely know what they saw in Kahlen  cycle 5  like cycle 3  this was not a great cycle either  but out of all the girls  NICOLE as a winner  eww  cycle 6  i liked Sara and Joanie  but Danielle is okay too  cycle 7  Caridee definitely deserved it  cycle 8  no  i didn't want Jaslene to win  i didn't like her  i saw other girls in that cycle with definitely more potential than her  although i did not see much of this cycle  good show  I've just seen it too many times to like it much anymore  D
