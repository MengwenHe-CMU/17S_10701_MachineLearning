Italian soft X Exorcist clone  Woman buy statue of crucified thief  Said thief comes to life and turns out to be the Devil with rape fantasies  Ivan Rassimov plays the Devil brilliantly  Mostly due to his gift of evil looks  And Because he was never above doing nudity  Good on him  The actress in the lead did a decent job  Her wide eyed innocence and the fact that she looked great naked helped  This one has a similar plot element to most Italian horror films  The girl's parents are filthy rich  and depraved  Watch it to get the details  Laura Gemser's husband  Gabriel Tinti  also appears as a random stud  His part is basically phoned-in  but like a cheap beer  it did the job  Fault the director for its failings  This could have been a horror sex classic
