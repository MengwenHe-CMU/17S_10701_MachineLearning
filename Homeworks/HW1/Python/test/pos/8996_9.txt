A very positive message for our youth is shown in this movie  Through the sport of rugby as a mean  a High School rugby coach leads his players in their behavior and lifestyle  ON and OFF the field   The acting and directing are good  The rugby shots are just OK if you know some rugby or really cool if don't know much about it  I recommend this movie  worth watching  especially at a point in time when this sport is gaining more and more adepts every day  The plot is based on a true story taking place in Utah  The coach portrayed in this movie has been at the helm of the Highlanders for over 30 years  and loosing only game every 3 years    Enjoy
