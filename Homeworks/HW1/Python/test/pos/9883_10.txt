This Film exhibits dear irony  shaggy-dog roundabout story lines woven with subtle cultural references  Classic parallels  masterful use of rich saturated color  and fabulous rendition of chase scenes a'la Keystone Cops   The ensemble work of the cast and entire crew is Charming  Literally  How else could I go on so   This film speaks to everyone  The deft and poignant use of so many universal archetypes  That's what makes this Film so deep down satisfying   As a mature student of film  I find Checking Out contains all the vital elements  Sure and Bergorra  it's not the GODFATHER  but would serve perfectly as follow up  Tragedy's mandatory Satyr play that sweetly binds our collective cathartic wounds  Get thee to a theatre and see this film  you will be treated to a unique masterpiece
