These guys combine low-brow with low-budget  It's glorious  Look- if you want Bergman  rent  7th Seal  or something  If you want to see gross-out humor and exploitation sex  this is the one  I think Jane Jensen as Julia makes it all watchable  She can actually act  really well   she's a complete dreamboat  and she doesn't seem to feel above it all
