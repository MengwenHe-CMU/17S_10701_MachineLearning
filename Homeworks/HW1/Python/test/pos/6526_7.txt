A   3 50 DVD can be a gamble and this was one that sort of paid off  A decent Saturday Night type movie that entertains if you gloss over the obvious plot flaws  Special effects are a bit few and far between with some repetition  and why does London always look as if it's in the 60's    If it had the budget of  say  Armageddon then I'm sure it would have performed better at the Box Office as the story is quite a good one  Overall  Tycus is consigned to B movie history but if you see it for   3 50 then it's worth buying
