I have spent many years studying all the great directors  like Kurosawa  Lean  Fulci  Lenzi  Deodato  Peckinpah  Kubrick and admire them greatly  My favourite film is Once upon a time in America  I have only recently become a fan of D'Amato  and while he was no horror master  his films were extreme whether it be soft core  hardcore or extreme  Porno Holocaust is now one of my favourite films  the way its shot is brilliant and the music is catchy  Joe D'Amato  wasn't a horror master  he's no Fulci or Bava  but however he was a master of erotica  no other director could shoot erotic films like him  he also never tried making any films outside of these genre's either  Long live Joe D'Aamto-Master of Porn and Erotica
