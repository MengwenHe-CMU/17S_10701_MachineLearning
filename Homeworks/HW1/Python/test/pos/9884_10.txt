Take someone you love or want to love and go see this film  It touches you in all the right places  All the other reviewers here have said it all  Perhaps the cynical will not be impressed  They only seem to like the stuff that leaves you depressed for days  This film is Ga-run-teed to stay with you for life  I am so gratified that the Director is not USC trained  This validates my premise that there is too much mediocrity and conformity in film these days  It is because of the USC lockstep mentality and inbreeding  Hooray for Jeff Hare and Richard Marcus  cast and crew  Well Done
