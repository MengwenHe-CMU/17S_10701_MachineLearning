Just want to inform you guys that this movie was actually pretty good      Thought it was a lame ass movie  but not at all  many moments in this movie wore pretty horrifying   This movie has enough blood  gore  and some sexy make out scenes of course  to keep any horror buff like me 100  satisfied  The cast was also pretty good IMO   Even though its not a high budget movie  the effects wore definitely kinda creepy sometimes   Worth watching if u like a kick ass horror movie thats for sure   - Tom
