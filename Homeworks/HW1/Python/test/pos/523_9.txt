During the making of this movie I once caught a statement on television about it  Something like   Is Killingg  nget now taking off Nazism   So  my comprehension of this movie  was from the beginning to get a notion of Nazism  When recently seeing this movie in the TV-version I had this filter before me and it wasn't difficult to see this  Strangely enough I haven't met this way of interpreting the film ever since I first heard it  These are the things I found in  Four shades of brown   In all four of the stories the lack of empathy leads to disaster  1  The crematory-worker shows no realistic empathy to the dead animals or to those who had to say goodbye to them  In the crematory-room in dealing with death and fire it's almost like a cheerful game to him  The seriousness of death and fire is not emphasized by the father and his boy accordingly  in ignorance pushes a button that leads to the disaster that injures his father severely  Possible lesson  The importance of showing the young adequate emotions  When they grow up they need to know what behavior leads to disaster and what emotions lead to good  2 The magician maneuvers his wife like an invisible puppeteer  Just when she thinks she has begun to cut off the strings to the masters hand  reaching for personality  integrity and joy  he pulls hard and she is back in desolation and despair  Their son has tried to revolt in creating his own life with perfection and  good  taste in opposite to his parents  bad  taste  The real problem he is carrying within is far from comprehensible to him  His fathers behavior passes on when suffocating his own wife in his spotless environment  Possible lesson  Oppression breeds bondage  3 The father who was abused as a child passes on sadism to his children when he cheats them on their inheritance  He robs them of their childhood and in the end even of their inheritance  Possible lesson  When no love given you cannot give any  4 The fathers abuse of his daughter creates in her a ruthless revenger with sadistic aggression  Here the ice cold Nazi-sadism becomes very obvious in physical violence  It gives a possible background and a somewhat plausible explanation to the actions of young  scin-head -nazists behavior when oppressing others   Possible lesson    Can Nazism take birth in a pervert home  Can the hideous consequence of ignoring empathy in family life  in the long run  be that room is given to sadistic Nazism   Very seldom does a movie contains so much  It reveals little by little as I meditate on it  I consider it brilliantly  painted  and the actors are superb  Especially the nice-seeming bloke played by Ulf Brunnberg that turns out to be the worst of all
