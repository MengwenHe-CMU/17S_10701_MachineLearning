Just watched it on the Hallmark Channel  I was surprised to John Denver  This movie was full of clich  s  but that is to be expected  a made for TV Christmas movie- come on   The acting is as good as any other '80's made for TV movie  The story is  as I said before  predictable and clich    but still good  If you are looking for a campy Christmas movie  it will certainly scratch your itch  I was also pleased when I learned that it took place in Georgetown  Colorado  It is a real mountain town west of Denver  Very cool as this is my home region  I was never a big John Denver fan  I always found him to be pretty foney  but he was a decent actor  He is very good as the good old boy like he played in this film  If you get the chance to watch it  than do  I'm sure it will be on again in 2007
