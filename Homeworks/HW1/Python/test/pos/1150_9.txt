I just cannot emphasize enough what a lovely movie this is  Just the memory of this movie right now enchants me  If you want to see a sweeping epic of a movie  with wonderful actors in vivid scenery  with great dialogue  reminding you of what early America could have been like  what the world could have been like back then    well   I highly recommend this movie  Especially during a time of war and conflict in Iraq   when our American image is not at all what it used to be   this movie takes you back to a time when we were just starting out  When being an American meant really picking yourself up by your bootstraps and getting going  When the world was such an untamed and unknown place  Well  this movie has that   and more  Enjoy
