I enjoy the National Anthem  I enjoy the National Anthem if for nothing else then  just before the Midnight News  I imagine I'm playing the cymbals in the band  Not as easy as you may think  One  two  three  four  One  two three  four  but then what  So I have sympathy with the practising bass drum player in Roy Andersson's wonderful film  patiently waiting for his cue listening to a very 70s cassette player  The 70s motif seems to continue throughout  with some classic  soulless furniture  Moreover  every scene has an eerie jade wash which emphasises the minute nuances of the subtlest of acting  Which brings me to Jessika Lundberg's outstanding purple boots  Boots which otherwise would have inspired a Silk Cult advertising campaign  But then the difficult bit  Someone asked me what it was about  Well there is a scene where the opening line as  I don't have that length in green  Brilliant  Straight out of a Gary Larson carton  I can't say what it's about  Go see yourself  Ron Plasma Hmm  Larson  Sounds Swedish  Viewed 15Apr08
