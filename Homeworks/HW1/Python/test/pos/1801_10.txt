This is a romantic  albeit cheesy movie that is one of my all time favorites  It is one of the many CLASSICS of the 80's genre like  Pretty in Pink  or  Some kind of Wonderful   Nic plays the traditional punk guy in love with the traditional valley  preppy girl Julie  It is a heartwarming love story that makes you root for him to win the girl in the end  True  most of the acting sucks but     I have been in love with Nic since seeing this in the theaters and have seen nearly every movie he's been in since  He's really grown as an actor but it is obvious in this early movie of his that he had a LOT of potential  If you love 80's movies  you will LOVE this classic  Go rent it
