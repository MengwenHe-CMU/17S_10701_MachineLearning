The plot starts out interesting  however  towards the end too many die in too short a time  turning the thriller-mystery aspect of the story into a slaughter  The only true highlights were Adam Beach and J  rgen Prochnow  who were once again their excellent selves  Nice try with an inappropriate last third  though a good ending
