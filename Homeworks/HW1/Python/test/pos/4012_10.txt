This is probably my favourite TV show ever  I love all the characters  especially Alex  who is the PERFECT woman  Always makes me laugh and feel good when I watch this show  There is just something about it that is amazing  hard to describe  It seems some or all of the episodes synchronise with music albums as well  Here are a few examples   The episodes start again when they end - but DON'T play end credits until the very end  but always play the opening credits  With most the episodes the album plays once and the episodes play twice  but some go on further   RADIOHEAD  PINK FLOYD  BOB Dylan  2 02 'Double bogey' Kid A   OK Computer  episode plays at least 4 times  2 14 'Saturn' Kid A   Meddle   Shot Of Love 2 19 'World without Alex' Kid A   Wish You Were Here   Pablo Honey episode plays at least 4 times  There are clues in the episodes which tell you which albums synchronise  Kid A may synchronise with EVERY episode
