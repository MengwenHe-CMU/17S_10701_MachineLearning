Following on directly from the last episode of the previous series Yes Minister  Jim Hacker now finds himself inside Number 10 Downing Street as Prime Minister of Great Britain  instead of a Cabinet Minister and a member of the government  he is now leading Her Majesty's Government  All this after some scheming maneuvers by Sir Humphrey Appleby after the previous Prime Minister resigned at the end of Yes Minister   Sir Humphrey Appleby is now the head of the Civil Service  I thought that this series was better than the first series  or though it did not last as long as the first series unfortunately
