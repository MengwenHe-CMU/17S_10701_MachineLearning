I watched this film with high expectations but was somewhat disappointed  Although I like this film and was engrossed by the story  I did not find it moving and think the ending falls flat  The story consists of the friendship between a man running a photo shop and his best customer who is a traffic Policewoman  The location is a quaint Korean village   This film is in some ways realistic as there is an element of tragedy and yet it is not melodramatic  However I was not ultimately moved by a film depicting a man who is loved so much by a woman  yet does not even give her the choice to enter his life  In my mind he is a sweet  noble loser  Good points - Excellent acting by the two main leads  enjoyable snapshot of village life Cons - Flat ending Overall - Good but I prefer the Before Sunrise and After Sunset films  or is it Before Sunset and After Sunrise
