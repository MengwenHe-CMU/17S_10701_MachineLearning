Terrific  deeply moving crime thriller starring Andy Lau and Lau Ching Wan  From the dizzying opening sequence to the extremely satisfying conclusion  this cat and mouser hardly misses a beat  Johnny To  again working with ace composer Arthur Wong  constructs another operatic actioner that grots in the face of its contemporaries  To's images are strong and moving  His cutting  combined with the extraordinary music cues  is exemplary  You are in the hands of a master cinematician  The two sequences in which Andy Lau  hides  from the cops on a bus by pretending to accompany a lithe beauty  Ruby Wong  are testament to To's unique directorial skills  Lau Ching Wan is strong and commanding as the harassed cop while Andy Lau is dynamic as a dying man avenging his father's death  This is superb movie-making  only mildly compromised by some bad English dubbing in one scene with criminal Waise Lee
