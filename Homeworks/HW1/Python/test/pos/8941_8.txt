This film had a distinct Woody Allen feel about it  so if you're not a fan of dry humor  dark humor  or back-handed humor  you probably could find something else to do  If you ARE  however  this is quirky  with some nice twists and a flowing  natural dialog  The story itself is quite engaging  not quite like a train wreck from which you cannot disengage your eyes  but close  I mean that in the best way possible  The intrigues are plenty  the twists are enough to fully engage the senses  and the characters are downright lovable  I had a great time with this movie  It rates an 8 3 10 from    the Fiend
