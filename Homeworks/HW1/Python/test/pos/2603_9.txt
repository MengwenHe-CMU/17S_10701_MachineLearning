The four signs on the road say  If You're Looking For Fun     You Don't Need A Reason    All You Need Is A Gun    It's Rabbit Season   In the woods  we see hundreds of  Rabbit Season  signs posted on every tree  We see more and more signs pointing exactly to Bugs Bunny's hole  Who's putting up all these signs  Daffy Duck  Daffy puts the last sign up  tiptoes away and says to us  the audience   Awfully unsporting of me  I know  But  what the hey - I gotta have some fun  Besides  it's really duck season   From that point  we now see Elmer Fudd  shotgun in hand     and a war of semantics between Bugs and Daffy with Bugs winning every time  Only in cartoons  thankfully  can we see someone getting shotgun-blasted in the head five times and keep going
