I had the pleasure of witnessing this brilliant film at a preview screening in Sydney  Although it was a pleasure to see it  Pleasure is not the emotion you are left with as the credits roll  2 37 is a film that tackles not just one stigma felt by young individuals but all of them  Chief of which is isolation  It is not just to place the films final galvanising scene on a pedestal above the others  but rather it is important to see it as the culmination  And from that  it is important to realise what it represents to both you as the viewer and to the people directly effected by it  2 37 is not a soft picture but the manner in which Mr Thalluri handles it's subject matter with a profound dignity and it's no holds barred approach acts as credit to it's message  I do not believe films such as 2 37 should be scaled by votes of favour  Rather it should be recommended to those looking for purpose in their viewing  A brilliantly crafted portrait of innocence lost  And a master stroke for a as of yet untaped talent  Not to be missed
