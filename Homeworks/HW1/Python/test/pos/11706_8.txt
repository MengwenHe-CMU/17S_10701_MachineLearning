Crackerjack is a simple but feelgood movie where the good guys are very good and the bad guys are very bad and the central character is tempted by both sides  The combination of the central character being played by Mick Malloy and the central setting being the local lawn bowls clubs drew an unusually broad crowd ranging from large numbers of teenagers to large numbers of senior citizens - and all laughed at the comedy  As would be expected of a movie with Mick Malloy and Judith Lucy there was quite a bit of swearing  but it was not overdone and the audience I sat with certainly enjoyed it  Mick Malloy did a good job as the lazy bloke who joined the bowls club  three times  simply to get parking spaces  one for himself and two for leasing to others at a premium  but who has everything fall down on him when he is required to play or lose his membership  Judith Lucy does a fine job as his local journalist love-interest and there are fabulous performances from Bill Hunter  Frank Wilson  Monica Maughan  Lois Ramsey and many others  John Clarke's dour role as the bad guy is not one of his funniest but he gives a solid performance  The not so subtle swipes at pokies provide a bit of a serious note to this otherwise light comedy  I'm sure that those who enjoyed The Castle and The Dish would also enjoy this movie
