Insanely well crafted mini-series  I recall seeing most of it twice when shown on American Playhouse on PBS  Was heavily promoted at the time  I believe it might have been one of the very early mini-series showing on PBS outside of the Masterpiece Theater series  The full length production was shown I believe only once during its first broadcast  Was 6-8 hours total  This length was edited down somewhat to 6 hours  Cut some interesting  but slow scenes  I am very much hoping that the folks holding its current rights do follow through and restore a complete  not edited version to DVD  Not worth creating a VHS version at this point  Would fit in very well in the mini-series or dramatic history genre
