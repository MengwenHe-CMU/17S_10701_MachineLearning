Movie watchers often say great movies must have 3 memorable scenes to be considered truly great  Broadcast news doesn't have three  it has twice that  This movie is extremely well written by James Brooks  Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks have never been better  I love this movie for many reasons  It is great because it makes you laugh and it makes you cry  Albert Brooks has several great lines and many unforgettable scenes    1 laughed   I can sing and read  I am singing while I read   with Midnight Train to Georgia playing in the background    2 laughed  Telling the William Hurt character that  You really blew the lid off of nookie   after watching Hurt's report on date-rape   3  Cried  When Aaron  A  Brooks  finally tells Jayne  Hunter  that he loves her and she can't end up with Hurt's character because he represents everything about journalism Jayne finds dispicable  Finally   4  laughed  who can forget the scene where Aaron anchors the weekend news    hilarious  This movie should have won an Oscar  It has everything I love in movies  great acting  intelligent script  and even a Jack Nicholson cameo
