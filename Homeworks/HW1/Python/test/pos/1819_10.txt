This gem captures early 80's life brilliantly  As a grad '83 boy myself  I must say that Valley Girl  along with Fast Times at Ridgemont High  stands out as the class of the teen sex film genre  The characters are accurate representatives of the era  the vapid mall chicks  pseudo punk rebels  preppy jocks are all represented here  I have seen this over ten times now  The music in the film was top notch  Unfortunately  these tunes could were never as popular in their era as those by arena cockrockers like Journey  Styx or Loverboy  Before the soundtrack existed  I searched out records and tapes  it was the 80's after all    of Josie Cotton  Sparks  Plimsouls and Modern English  This movie deserves respect  It isn't just a good 80's teen flick  It is a great film  Period
