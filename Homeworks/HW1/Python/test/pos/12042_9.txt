Darr is an brilliant movie  It is 1 of my favourite films  SRK has done a mind blowing job in the movie     this role couldn't have been played by anyone else because this type of role only suits SRK    SRK plays a mental villain in the film   SRK's performance in this movie is the best performance ever in boll wood    SRK deserves an honour and an encouraging appeal for his fantastic performance    Juhi also delivers an excellent performance   Sunny Deol looked strong and physically fit in the film
