I love this movie  I just saw it for the first time about 10 hours ago and had to rewind it so that my sister could watch it  This movie is so funny  There are two times that I was laughing so hard my sides hurt  I didn't expect to watch a movie so funny  I really only wanted to see it because Laura Fraser is in it  I first saw her in Titus which is an awesome movie as well  Like others reviewers have said  too many people are expecting a deep moving film  You are not going to get it  What you will get is humor  eye candy and the chance to ask yourself exactly what your perfect mate would look like if you could create them  You can also wonder what it would be like to be stuck in the body of the opposite sex  A hilarious sequence involves Justine first seeing herself as a naked man  I was cracking up  I swear  this movie is the most imaginative teen film that I have ever seen and it is now my favorite  Just remember why movies were originally created  as entertainment not philosophy in motion  Remember this and you will have a great time watching Virtual Sexuality
