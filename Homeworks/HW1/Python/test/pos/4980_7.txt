Stanwyck at her villainous best  Robinson her equal - as ruthless land barons in this fairly ordinary western  Some good action scenes  strong use of location  colour and Cinemascope  But why the obvious use of stock footage in the stampede scene  Ford is dependable as always and Foster is strong as Robinson's daughter  but it is the baddies' film  And it's not just Stanwyck and Robinson - Brian Keith makes a surprisingly dashing villain as Stanwyck's lover  and Richard Jaeckel is unforgettable as a cold-hearted killer  See it for the camp value
