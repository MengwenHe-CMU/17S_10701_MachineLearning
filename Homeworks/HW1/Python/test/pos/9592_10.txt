To anyone who is interested  I have managed to get this on DVD from Ebay  haven't received it yet - any day now   I have been desperate to get this even if it is a VHS quality put on a DVD I don't mind  So to anyone interested get in touch with me and maybe I can help you out  To be honest it's ridiculous that I've had to wait nearly 7 years to see this again but boy it will be worth it  All my mates at work are desperate to see it too  Anyway I'll post later regarding the quality  Just do a search on Ebay if u want it guys  it's there to buy
