Mark Blankfield played Jekyll and Hyde  Michael McGuire was the dad  Tim Thomerson was the plastic surgeon  Did you even see this movie  I doubt it  Blankfield was fairly popular at this time for playing the pill-popping doctor on Fridays  Thomerson has been funny in anything he does  from movies to series to stand-up comedy  If I ever find this movie on DVD I will definitely buy it  I recorded this movie off of HBO back in '82 and have pretty much worn out the tape  One of the funniest takes on the Jekyll   Hyde theme ever  Of course  with all the cocaine references in this movie  it'd be panned as being way too politically incorrect today  as would Cheech and Chong  Too bad  because it is FUNNY  FUNNY  FUNNY
