The movie starts out with three people on a play it by ear holiday who decide to first visit a crocodile farm and then go on to a little lighter activity  a  fishing  tour  You pick up some interesting information about crocodiles during their visit to the farm and the information adds just enough to increase the suspense later during the movie as you recall what was told earlier on  The action in the movie is well timed and not over done  Suspense is built through the  what ifs   the  unknown   and the sometimes gut wrenching decisions the characters make in the movie  I found myself wondering what I would do if I was in the same boat  no pun intended  The film quality was really good and the effects where realistic  believable and not over the top or cartoon looking and out of place  the way you sometimes get with CGI  As a horror movie buff I watch just about every horror movie I can get my hands on  in just about every genre  and this is one of the best  crocodile  horror movies  if not the best I have seen  Watch this movie and you will not be disappointed
