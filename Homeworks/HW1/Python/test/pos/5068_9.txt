Very good political thriller regarding the aftermath of terrorism and the using of political torture to obtain one's objectives in flushing out the terrorists  The story is interwoven where two families are adversely affected by the terrorist events  This is one of Meryl Streep's best roles in years  She plays a cold  calculating  cunning director of the CIA who allows these things to go on  She is out of the George Bush-Dick Cheney school of handling the war on terrorism  Had her part been expanded  Miss Streep certainly would have been up for an award at Oscar time  Jake Gyllenhaal is our hero  A CIA agent who really can't take what's going on  We have a terrorist who actually has a heart and it costs him his life in this well directed  finely paced film  Alan Arkin appears briefly in the part of a conniving senator  Mr  Arkin seems to get better with age
