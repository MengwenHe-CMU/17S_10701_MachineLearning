To experience Head you really need to understand where the Monkees were when they filmed it  This was as their series was coming to a close and the group was near break up  Their inventive and comedic series  sort of an American Idol of their day  took four unknown actors and formed a manufactured supergroup around them  This is their take on their  manufactured image  and status as the 2nd tier Beatles  They always felt they were in a box  trapped  and unable to find credibility despite their talents  It is also a hell of a musical-trippy  inventive  I have the soundtrack  and full of surprises  See it with an open mind
