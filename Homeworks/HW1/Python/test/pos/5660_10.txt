I finally managed to see this movie   after so many years of expectancy    I was so curious to see if this movie it is as bad as some people say   And my opinion is that this movie it wasn't bad at all on the contrary it was AMAZING    I enjoyed every second from it   from the beginning until the end    The actors were great they sent me the feeling that i was living the story at the same time as the movie was playing    The landscapes were so beautiful were the film was shot   and it did charmed me   Also the music was extraordinary and i have nothing to reproach   I think that the plot was very original i don't think that i saw a movie like this    It is a shame that it isn't recognized all over the world  to bad for those who didn't get the chance to see it  i give this movie 10 10
