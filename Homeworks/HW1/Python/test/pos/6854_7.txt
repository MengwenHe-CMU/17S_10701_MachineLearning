I liked this film a lot  The actors were great  particularly Potente  who is different in every role  F  rmann  who is also able to play anyone  and Loos  who spices things up  she is also a talented singer - she sings the song  My Truth   heard when one character cranks up the stereo in the lab   Anatomie is a good horror flick  which pays attention to its characters  It is also very gory at times  and the set design is innovative  It is too bad they had to make a sequel  which is nowhere near the original  On a side note  two other things definitely worth mentioning  The DVD is not dubbed  which makes for a better experience of the film  Also  make sure to keep watching after the final credits start rolling
