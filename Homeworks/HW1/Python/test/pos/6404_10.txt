I am right now watching  The Big Chill  on DVD  One of its actors is Meg Tilly  I looked it up on IMDb which led me to reading Meg's bio which mentioned and reminded me of Meg's sister Jennifer Tilly whose filmography included  Key West   which was one of my wife's and my favorite shows  I then read this entire thread of reviews  Wow  I really loved that show also and agree with all of the sentiments about the quirkiness and uniqueness of the characters and situations  As most everyone else  I wish it was on DVD or otherwise available  The last reviewer says he watches it on reruns so I wish I knew what network  channel  day  times it is on  So if anyone knows how we can watch episodes of  Key West   please let us know
