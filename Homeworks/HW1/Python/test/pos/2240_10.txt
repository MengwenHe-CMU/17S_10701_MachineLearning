I'd like to point out these excellent points in favor of this movie   1 Angelina Jolie sex scene   2 Foley artist outdid themselves   3 plot was quite thick   4 DVD does includes trailers and chapter stops  5 no animals were harmed in the making of the movie   6 homages to blade runner through out the film   7 burning trash cans   8 funny guy with no legs   9 Voice overs by Jack Palance added a real dynamic element to the film    10 Sage advise  for example  When you dine with the devil bring a long spoon     11 Angelina Jolie was only 18   To sum it up  an evening of entertainment was provided
