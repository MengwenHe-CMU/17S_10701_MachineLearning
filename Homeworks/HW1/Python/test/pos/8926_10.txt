I read a viciously hidden remarks on a previous comments stating that this film showed a bunch of gay guys romping around their gayness  This couldn't be more misleading   Eighteen  is not a gay film  It has only three gay characters in it and one of them is the victim of prejudice of people like the one who wrote the comments  despite his confession of fairness  Pip's grandfather was not gay  The tender scene of the soldier and his sergeant is male bonding at the crucial moment of death  But some people gets appalled by a kiss and welcome scene of guts flying out of a man killed by a bomb  The focus of the film is the straight relationship of Pip and that sweet girl and their facing their social obligation and parenthood  Ralph Rewes www r1313 info
