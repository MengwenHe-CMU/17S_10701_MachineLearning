This series  while idealized and fictionalized  has the quirkiness  sultriness  and good-heartedness that does come from living on an island  I lived in an out of the way part of Hawaii for a few years and found some hilarious  quirky  and fun people in some remote  non-tourist  areas  Every time I see the reruns of this series  I fondly compare my memories of experiences in out-of-the-way parts of Hawaii with the memories portrayed and fictionalized in Key West  This series is not reality television  I hate reality television  It is from the era when people still wrote creative TV shows  Give me a  young writer  who takes their inspiration from the  angels in the spray  wizards in the palm trees and elves in the seashells  any day
