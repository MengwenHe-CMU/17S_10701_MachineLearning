The best Batman movie of the 90's no doubt about it  This movie takes place in a city filled with insecurity and nightmares  Although the villains are somewhat cheesy  they fit perfect for the movie's tone of colorful but nightmarish cinematography   The performances are really great and the comic tone behind them really delivers expectations   Don't get fooled by the cheesy outfits  this is a movie in the pure style of Burton  That can't be described  Burton is a sui generis director that took the Batman franchise to another obscure level but not forgetting about it's comic style past   Recommended for fans of action cinema and best of all  if it deals with super heroes
