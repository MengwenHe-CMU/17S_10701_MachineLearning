This is the single greatest movie I have ever seen  Davey Mr  Slaussen is simultaneously  1  Tortured about his talents  e g    I can control it  I can  I shouldn't have to hiiiide it  It feeeeeeeeeels good     2  Desperate to make friends  e g    How's the soup   The soup is very good    Would you like some crackers with your soup    I'd like some more crackers  please    How's that    Yes  the soup is very good   3  Proud of his accomplishments  e g   Pretty neat trick  huh    4  A ladies man  e g    You're so pretty  Why don't you like me     and 5  Sometimes  very  very angry  e g    You can't get away    Connors should have received an academy award for best actor for this movie  I mean  who was possibly better   Tanya Roberts rocketed to the stratosphere following her performance in TT  It's a wonder not all of the stars of this masterpiece did not go on to have brilliant careers  I highly  highly recommend this film  It's available on amazon com  Everyone should own it  Make a night of it and have a bowl of soup while you watch
