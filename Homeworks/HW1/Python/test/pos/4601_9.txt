This movie was quite a pleasant surprise  I had anticipated it for a long time  and was afraid going in that it couldn't possibly live up to my expectations  It exceeded them  I adored this movie  Hilarious from start to finish  stay until after the end credits    it is absolutely remarkable how a movie about dumb and annoying characters can be so intelligent  witty  and engaging  With it's obvious matte paintings  the movie's future Earth recalls the Planet of the Apes series and other Sci-Fi movies of that era  In fact  this movie is essentially Planet of the Apes  but with people who are the mental equivalent of apes  It moves at a fairly brisk pace  and Luke Wilson carries the movie quite well  with a character that recalls the one he played in  Bottle Rocket    There's even a not-so-subtle nod to  Bottle Rocket  in an early scene   Maya Rudoulph is also surprisingly good as a former  painter  who was frozen as well  Despite all its strengths   Idiocracy  has the distinct feel of a movie that was taken away from the director editor before it could be fine-tuned  I cannot for the life of me understand why a movie this funny would just be dumped into a few theaters with no advanced screenings  no trailers  no marketing whatsoever  It's as if the studio decided they were not going to spend any more on it and just walked away  Or maybe they thought the movie had the makings of a cult classic  and the only way for it to become a true cult classic was to set it up to fail   Whatever the case  it is a shame  because Mike Judge and this film in particular deserve better  I predict this movie will have real legs on DVD  and word of mouth will propel it to the success it deserves  Perhaps the Fox Executives saw themselves in the characters  were confused  and thought it was a documentary
