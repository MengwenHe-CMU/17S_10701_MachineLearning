I only went to see this movie because I have always liked Kevin Costner  I felt that Ashton did a great job in the Butterfly Effect  Unfortunately  even though these two actors were are capable of good if not great acting moments some of that was missing here  Some of the scenes were just not believable and didn't have enough story line support  Though the movie claims influence from the hurricane Katrina aftermath  there was very little  none  to that effect in the movie  Overall  I liked the fact that the movie brought forward some of what goes into saving lives from a water perspective  The special effects were pretty good and more than a little intimidating  Not sure I'll ever go deep sea fishing again    I expected a little more emotion in the film than what was presented  Definitely a movie that could've been seen on DVD
