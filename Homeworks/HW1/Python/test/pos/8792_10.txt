I just adore this film  I love all characters and I can watch it again and again   and I use to listen to the soundtrack again and again  Although I have seen it about two years after it was made and I have never been such youngster as Jip and company I can understand them and I love their stories  And if somebody thinks this film is crap  I disagree and I say it is full of positive energy and friendship and love   and full of youth  The weekend has landed   enjoy it
