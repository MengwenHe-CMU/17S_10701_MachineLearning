I will always think of Mr  Firth as Dorian Gray  if I live to be 100  Perfectly acted and directed  bringing Oscar Wilde's insight  wit and humor alive with an absolute and utter perfection unusual in television  More proof that the BBC more than makes up in talent what it doesn't always have in money  A must have for all Wilde fans-and indeed for everyone else  Inspired and perfected  every one of the actors looked exactly right for the role and every shot was well done  By the end I found that I loved every single character in a way that no other movie of the type had ever inspired  Watch it  then try to watch another version  It's just not the same  is it
