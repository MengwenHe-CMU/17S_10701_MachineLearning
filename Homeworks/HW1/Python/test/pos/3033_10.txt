Superb story of a dedicated young teacher who sets out teaching minority children in an area off South Carolina  Jon Voight is just tremendous as the headstrong  dedicated  idealistic teacher who faces this challenge despite a principal  who believes in stern discipline and has little regard for modern educational techniques as well as a crusty old school superintendent  played with relish by the late Hume Cronyn  Madge Sinclair is the principal who loves her babies  As I'm a retired teacher  I could in some ways relate to this excellent film  The ignorance shown here as well as the lack of cooperation with officials is also quite apparent in urban areas  Voight realizes that these children need far more than the traditional teachings of a classroom  He has them go out and experience life by themselves by learning outdoors  The end is a definite downer but so true to life  Amazing that such backward students had a zest for learning and were well disciplined  I guess that answers my question  The behavior was there and they were motivated to succeed despite their environment  The ending will just tug at your heart  It was memorable and so well poignant
