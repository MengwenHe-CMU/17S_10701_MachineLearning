Aaliyah blows all the female cast members out of the water  including the official love interest Marguerite Moreau  I would have loved to see this movie play out as Akasha's power trip  Aaliyah is simply electrifying whenever she is on the screen  She does sensual  beautiful and menacing to the power of 10  Watching her take on a bar full of vampires is a sight to behold  Lena Olin is cast in the ungrateful role of  the older woman   which is hugely unjustified  She looks fantastic and at 46  according to the IMDb  still looks stunning  The story unfortunately is very limited plot wise  we've seen it all before  etc  The most heart wrenching is Akasha's death scene  especially keeping in mind what happened to Aaliyah after filming  All in all  a remarkable vampire movie
