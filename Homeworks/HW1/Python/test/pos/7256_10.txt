Plunkett   Macleane falls into my favourite genre of film  historical action adventure with comedy  which is probably why I rate it so highly  The action centres around a highwayman  Plunkett  and a layabout 'gentleman' who gets entangled with him and his schemes  Macleane   This leads to all sorts of escapades and adventures which are all tinged with comedy  There is also  of course  a love interest  The rest of the cast is made up of a number of vibrant  larger than life characters who add to the atmosphere of the film and show the excesses of the wealthy at this time  This is an enjoyable film with a fairly simple but worthwhile plot that provides plenty of entertainment
