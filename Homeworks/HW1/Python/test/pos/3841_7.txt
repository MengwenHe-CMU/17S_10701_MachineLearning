I have seen this movie only once  several years ago  But I remember liking it a lot    Spoilers ahead   An old famous opera singer is retired and she decides to give all the money she has to her cats  Her butler hears this and plots to get rid of the cats so he can have the fortune  He puts knockout drops in their milk  When they wake up  they find themselves miles away  They must journey back to their house before it is too late  With the help of an independent-minded tomcat and other animal accomplices  while evading the butler and foiling his plan  Could have been better  but it also could have been a lot worse  My Score  7 10
