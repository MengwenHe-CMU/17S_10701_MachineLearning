Man am I stoked I can leave feedback for this 10 minutes romp  I love it  After not seeing it in years  I happened upon it the other day and watched it over and over  'Stop shaking your eyes' and 'shake a rock and roll band' and 'stop sawing the table' are freaking classic lines  The art is delightfully raw  The dialog sparse and wonderful  Just find it and love it  Cannot recommend this enough  Thank you high school art teacher Mrs  Kogan for showing us this over and over  Thank you NFB for letting it be made  Thank you MTS for showing it  for free at the moment at least   I want a Big Snit t-shirt now  I'd love an animation cell  but at 440 00 a pop  that won't happen  Find this flick  and watch it
