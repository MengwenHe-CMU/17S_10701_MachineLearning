In Spain  the former sailor Ram  n Sampedro  Javier Bardem  has been quadriplegic for twenty-eight years and is fighting in court for his right of practicing euthanasia through an association that defends the freedom of choice and leaded by his friend G  ne  Clara Segura   Ram  n is introduced to the lawyer that is defending his cause  Julia  Bel  n Rueda   who has a degenerative fatal disease  and meets Rosa  Lola Due  as   a lonely worker that has been abused by men  Their relationship changes the behavior and viewpoint of life of Rosa and Julia  The Chilean Alejandro Amen  bar is  in my opinion  one of the best contemporary directors  His filmography released in Brazil is composed by excellent and original movies   Abre Los Ojos    Tesis    The Others  and  Mar Adentro   Javier Bardem is probably the best actor in Spain in the present days  Their association produced this sensitive drama about a very polemic theme  the right of committing euthanasia  This drama is never corny or depressive  since the screenplay uses humor as a relieve valve in the most dramatic situations  The performances of the cast are perfect  with characters having and defending different positions regarding this unpleasant theme  The dialogs and lines are very solid and intelligent  I noted in IMDb plot outline that this movie is based on the real-life story of Ram  n Sampedro  Unfortunately  neither the movie nor the DVD gives this important information  My vote is nine  Title  Brazil    Mar Adentro    Sea Inside
