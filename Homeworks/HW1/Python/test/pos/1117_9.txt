A wonderful family movie   a beautiful horse movie  75   entertainment  Casey  Buddy  Kelly Marsh are very interesting and lovable characters  The horses are real beauties  Has the horse racing as a backdrop for showing how luck is sometimes nothing but some good commonsense  Shows how kids can do stupid things for stupid reasons  Shows how adults can do stupid things for selfish reasons  The very realistically portrayed characters transform the unrealistic theme of the film into something everyone can relate to  Andrew Rubin puts in a wonderful performance as Buddy the sensible elder brother  Somewhat reminded me of Aidan Quinn eyes  speech delivery  facial appearance    Casey makes you fall in love with the character because of the earnestness  Sarah Blue is also nicely portrayed by Alexis Smith  Lloyd Bourdelle  the father  is played by Walter Matthau and he IS the character  Though there is room for improvement in the movie  its a very enjoyable  feel-good movie
