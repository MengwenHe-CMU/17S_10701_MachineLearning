My children  DD 7 and DS 10  enjoyed the movie so much they were squirming in their seats  It was good  old fashioned  Rated G  family fun  This movie was made for kids     someone really understands them  It was fun to see Julia Roberts  Brice Willis  Garth Brooks and the other stars make their cameo appearances  As someone who lives in the city the fictional  Big Texas  was modeled after  I can say that they did an honest and accurate portrayal  The kids looked like kids  not like superstars  I hope everyone supports this movie to send the message to Hollywood that we need more movies like this  Go see it  then spread the word
