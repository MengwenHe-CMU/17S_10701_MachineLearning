Blade is a fantastic action thriller that keeps you captured for the whole duration and Wesley Snipes delivers what I would say to be his best performance yet  This film has everything that you would ask for in an action thriller  it has plenty of blood  guts and gore  a twisted  disturbed bad buy  moments of humour but most importantly a very good story line with plenty of twists  Their is constant action throughout the film with breathtaking stunts and effects  Wesley Snipes fighting movement is fantastic  This film is in my opinion a must see  Wesley Snipes cool  solid appearance makes this film and I can't wait for the sequel 'BLADE 2' being released next year  My IMDB Rating - 9 out of 10
