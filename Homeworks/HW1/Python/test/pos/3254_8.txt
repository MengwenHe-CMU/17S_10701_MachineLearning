Having seen  and loved this film in Australia  I was very keen to get me paws on a copy  I got one on DVD back in the UK only to find that it's a very different edit  The domestic Australain edit I saw is snappier  The UK  and I presume European  edits spends a lot longer on the narrator played by Jimmy's dead brother And in truth belabours that and few other points to no real benefit  It is not a serious criticism  but the Oz edit is just brisker and I think more assured  I can't say why they felt it needed expansion for the overseas market  So careful about which one you go for  I went for both
