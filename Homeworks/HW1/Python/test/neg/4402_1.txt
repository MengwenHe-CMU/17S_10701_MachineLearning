This is like a school video project and a propaganda film that puts the whole class as well as the teacher to sleep  Utterly boring long silent yes  silent  strings of unrelated video clips  Instead of this movie watch the paint dry or the grass grow- it will be more interesting unless you enjoy seeing Arabs being malicious to everyone around them  Sulieman  the Director  should be embarrassed of this lame waste of film  It deserves a one for the movie quality  a zero for the ridiculous propaganda message and a negative number for the script  or lack thereof
