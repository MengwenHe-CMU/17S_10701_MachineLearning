Can you people please stop believing everything this man says  Get your facts straight before you start praising this liar  He's not even from Flint  He just says that to keep his  blue collar  look  He's  from a rich suburb next to Flint  I mean he went to a private school  His parents paid for him to go to school  Wow  that sure does seem like they suffered a lot from Flint going to the dumps  He was also born in Canada  Oh wait  that makes him a Canadian citizen  I wish he would just move there  Instead he lives here in his 1 million dollar New York apartment  Thats working class right there  I sure can't wait for his DVD set to come out  I want to here him talking about how big corporations are bad  Where will I get those dvds  Oh yeah  at Target and Wal-Mart  The two biggest corporations in America  which were also the only two stores allowed to sell them
