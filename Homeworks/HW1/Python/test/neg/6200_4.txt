I was really geared up to watch when two of best movie critics tagged this movie as a 'laugh riot'  But the movie turned out be disappointing  You will be advised to watch this movie keeping your brains at home but you simply can't ignore the flaws and the shortcomings  1  The missile scene was total stupidity  2  Katrina Kaif and Govinda pair looked awful   He's 49 and she's just 24    more than double of her age  3  Salman's comedy is less of acting and more of overacting  4  Songs are good but interrupts the pace of the movie  5  Some scenes were deliberately attempted by the movie makers to be funny  and 6  Poor and flawed story  However  there are few pluses- 1  Govinda  Great Individual Performance  2  Some scenes are actually quite funny  3  Kattrina Kaif  Looks and Acting keeps on improving with every film  4  Rajpal Yadav's Don sequences  Though under-utilized but hilarious  So 4 good points  6 bad ones   this one gets 4 10
