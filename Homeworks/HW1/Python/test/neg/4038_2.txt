This is without a doubt the STUPIDEST movie of all time  I don't know who I'm angrier at--the idiots who made this or my video store for actually carrying this piece of crap   I can't even begin to name all of the things wrong with this horrible wanna-be movie  All of the dialogue sounds like it was made up on the spot  and the acting is the worst I have ever seen in any movie-EVER   There is nothing about the script that would appeal to any decent person  in fact I don't think they even had a script  they just made up everything as they went along--and you can tell  The  women   i e  men dressed up in drag trying to look like women  in the costumes looked so ridiculous  I guess they were trying to be sexy but--NOT SO MUCH   Especially that old woman-disgusting  There is nothing scary about this movie  the only thing scary is that somebody else might actually rent it and have to watch it  No brain required for watching this  you must be a total loser to want to see this movie  Don't forget-- I WARNED YOU
