Outside Sweden you are not expected have seen this movie  Happy you  The cast includes several actors that are important part of modern the Swedish movie history  And still    Seems like Peter Dalle only had a an idea lasting for about 20 minutes  Robert Gustafson is totally misused in this movie  trying to copy a younger G  sta Ekman  Ekman  by the way  is the only actor fulfilling the expectations   Credit that can be given is for the photo  splendid idea using black and white  Music is OK  But over-all it's a waste of god actors and the time of the audience
