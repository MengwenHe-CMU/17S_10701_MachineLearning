I usually enjoy underground movies and antiheroes but this is a bad joke  I wonder how this can be called a movie  All these people are loosers and the filmmaker doesn't succeed in making them interesting at all  They are not funny  not tragic just plain stupid and boring  May be I missed something but I won't watch it again to find out what  Anybody with a camcorder can do better than that    I give it a 1 for the originality  All the rest is crap
