I'M BOUT IT 1997  Developed   published by No Limit Films   Pros  Absolutely none   Cons  I don't even know where to begin  Plot summary  Master P plays a drug dealer that looks  talks  and acts more like a live-action cartoon character  That's all the plot I got out of this movie  Review  I remember back when I was in the ninth grade during its release and everyone in my class praised this clown called Master P  This movie is so bad  it's not even funny  All the characters in this film are extremely tired stereotypes  the audio is only audible when music plays  and the movie looks like it was videotaped off a public access channel  Luckily  I didn't buy this film like all my other inner-city degenerate classmates  My rating 1 out of 10 My verdict  Avoid this video like its a sexually-transmitted disease
