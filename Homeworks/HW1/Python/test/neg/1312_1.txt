This awful effort just goes to show what happens when you not only use computers to generate the effects  but also let them devise the plot and write the script  Someone somewhere has obviously come up with a new bit of software that asks a few questions then churns out four hours of loosely connected clich  s  lousy dialogue and a collection of stock characters that you end up wishing had all drowned in the first five minutes  Tom Courtney took the prize for worst performance  Saying that he was wooden would be an insult to trees  It's hard to fault Robert Carlyle in almost anything he does  but the odds were stacked against even him in this one  especially since he was for some unaccountable reason required to adopt a gor' blimey London accent  A complete washout
