Dull acting  weak script   worst spanish movie in years   I was attracted by the  naked  beauty of Paz Vega  but as an actress she's useless  you almost can't understand what she's saying    About the story there's not much coherent to say   we heard of it before  but as this is a  modern Carmen  we find a few changes  -The french soldier is now a basque soldier  -Merimee himself is a character in the story  -Carmen is a dangerous  bandolera  in love with a famous  matador  and she can speak fluent basque    Can anyone understand this mess
