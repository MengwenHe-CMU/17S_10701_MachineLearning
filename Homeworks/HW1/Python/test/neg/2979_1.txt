This feels like a feature-lenght treatment of a comedy-routine that could have also been told in a ten-minute short  Also  technical credits are sup-par  The film really feels like a film school diploma project  The cast is a mix of seasoned stage pros and talented newcomers but the problems is the superficial scrip  Their lines feel constructed  exactly like cued TV show material  The director fails to take his protagonists seriously  therefore we are not touched by their problems and conflicts  The film has been cleverly marketed and offers a unique selling point  but in the end the film disappoints on all levels
