I like Ali G's show  I believe the guy has comedic instinct  but hasn't  yet  developed it to a talent  The movie is a little worse than I was expecting  I don't find Ali-G offensive  just stupid  Jokes for 5-year olds  some good  some terrible  If you want to watch a movie that seems  offensive   but is actually funny  see Tom Green's 'Freddy Got Fingered'  2 10
