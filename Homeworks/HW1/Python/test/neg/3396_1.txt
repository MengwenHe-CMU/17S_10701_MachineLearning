This is my opinion of this movie  expressed in its dialogs  To be more serious  i can't say this movie is a bad moment but i didn't enjoy it either   First  I was simply indifferent   couldn't get my mind into the apes world  Even though the make-up are very realistic  the constant screaming was irritating  May the film have changed apes for cats and it's a cult movie for me in relation to my fondness of the latter  The second part is more interesting  with the talent and freshness of then newcomers  Macdowell   Lambert   but i felt alienated  all the story is located in a big British mansion  no matter how luxurious is it  it was like a prison for me  At last  it could be a good adaptation of the Burroughs' story of Tarzan   I don't know  having never read the book  or seen the Disney     In conclusion  i don't have any good moments to remember  so one viewing would be enough for me   I should have guessed my boredom after the endless freeze called  Overture  at the beginning    What's the meaning  Only the director knows it
