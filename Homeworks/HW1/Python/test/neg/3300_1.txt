There are shows and films I've seen and subsequently read reviews of on IMDb com that I've disagreed with  and been happy to accept that there has just been a difference of opinion  Reading positive reviews of this filth merely puts me in mind of a sinister conspiracy involving TV network employees being ordered to browse the internet  posting unconvincingly positive reviews for programmes they themselves are responsible for  How else would one explain a review opining that this show is  sure to become a phenomenon  a full year after it's become clear its going to be nothing of the sort  I won't waste words describing this mess  but suffice to say if you enjoy  wives who emasculate their husbands  husbands who emasculate their sons  children who are disrespectful jackasses towards their parents and absolutely no other threads of behaviour or subtext to legitimise characters that are basically just unfunny one-liner spewing automatons  then watch this show  I  on the other hand  have some Seinfeld DVDs to get through  Futurama - Cancelled  TItus - Cancelled  Arrested Development - Cancelled  The War At Home - Renewed  No justice
