I think  category 6  day of destruction  was very unrealistic  The digital effects where like a children's cartoon   The actors didn't act realistically  for example  when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her   The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on   The only interesting character was Tornado Tommy  he was funny  Please keep the special effects real  I liked the comment   What did we do to p i s s-off Mother Nature   I don't know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines  What else can I say the movie is so boring  I think my comment will be equally boring
