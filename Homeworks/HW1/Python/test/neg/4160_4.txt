   SPOILERS       SPOILERS    I saw this movie last night at a screening  I started out already liking Tim Robbins and loving sci-fi  The first third of the movie was very cool  The score was good  the cinematography was interesting  the film maker's vision of the future was realistic yet starkly interesting nonetheless  I remember thinking to myself   this is the most intelligently done sci-fi movie I've seen in a while   Then they just couldn't keep it together  Although from the outset  there were a number of more  rough around the edges  issues with this film  namely the editing  and later some of the writing plot development   these issues were forgivable  They became unforgivable once the movie sort of lost all momentum around the half way mark  and then the film just got tedious when you realized that it wasn't going to go anywhere at all   Robbins could not breathe life into his character  but did the best he could  His female counterpart  her name escapes me now  was good in her role  The main reason for the meandering of the movie seemed to be that the film makers could not decide whether or not to do a sci-fi movie or a futuristic love story  They ended up with neither  Good  Some of the cinematography  grainy  it felt like  21 days later  some times  Very fitting for a futuristic movie like this  I dug some of the location shots  The music was cool  The film makers vision of the future was realistic but still cool and interesting  I liked the interactions with the other minor characters in the movie  Some of the writing was interesting  early on    The girl who played Maria Gonzales  name   can't recall   she was good     SPOILERS BELOW    A few questions comments  I felt that a lot of the futuristic things in this movie were convenient to fix a patchwork story  Namely VIRUSES  Obviously the virus they gave her at the end of the film that made her physically 'afraid' of him was just there so that they could stick in another sex scene and then she could uncontrollably report him for Code 46  Then they take him away and erase his memory and the movie ends  Classic 'dream sequence' cop-out ending if you ask me  ties up all the loose ends very neatly if you just make it all a dream right  Was Robbin's character naturally good as intuition or was it the virus  Why didn't they explore the myriad of issues surrounding the girl being a clone of his mom  That could have made some interesting story  At first I like the salutations from across the globe in everyone's speech  But it became intrusive especially since their accents were not convincing  I get it  the future will undoubtedly be racially and culturally more androgynous  but it started feeling like an AT T Global Networking commercial by the end of it  If they were 'outside' how could they have gotten busted for Code 46  'Cover' was never well defined  Sometimes it seemed as trivial as a Visa  and other times it was as vital as life or death  Again  loose definitions allow them to use it for gluing disparate parts of the plot together  Okay  I'm starting to get to negative about it  so I'll stop  There were some cool scenes  and interesting things about this movie  but that only gives it a 4 10
