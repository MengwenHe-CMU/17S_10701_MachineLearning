Although normally my preference is not for romantic dramas  seeing this film left me a little short  It had promise  the characters and relationships could have been explored much deeper than they did  yet the story seemed not to understand the direction it wanted to take  The comparisions and parallels within the story  especially the three generations of women in the family  had a lot of potential  but somehow didn't fully extend itself  It could have made the film much easier to relate to and attach to which is the aim of any film about lost-love and life regained  IMHO  I think the film suffered from a lack of direction in the writing  although Harry Connick Jnr and Sandra Bullock did try desperatly to breath a little life into otherwise flat character outlines  It's not that this is a bad film  some parts leave you understanding the reasons for various plot developments  its just that this film is underdone  and a little flat overall
