Having sat and watched this film I can only wonder at the reasons for creating the film  This was without a doubt one of the worst films I've ever seen and had no redeeming features  If it was supposed to be funny then it might have managed to be a very weak comedy but as an action thriller it was dire  Slow  no plot  no real action  nothing approaching good dialogue and I've no idea about the characters  What else can I say  Avoid
