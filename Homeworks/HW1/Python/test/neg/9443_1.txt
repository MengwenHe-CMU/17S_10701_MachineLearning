Maybe James P  Lay knows what do to in the sound department if a director supervises him  In 'Dreamland  2007 ' however  he cannot accomplish anything as a writer or as a director  There is absolutely nothing in this film  no story  no character building  no events  no atmosphere  no plot  no twists  no acting that deserves that name  In any of those departments this movie is billions of light years behind any short film that has some actual thinking in it  even a one minute one  It has nothing to do with any of David Lynch's works  I actually think it could be used as mental torture or as negative propaganda material against the West  Recommend it only to your worst enemies
