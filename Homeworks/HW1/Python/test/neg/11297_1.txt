 Hannibal SPOILERS  Hannibal Lecter  Anthony Hopkins  is back    for a travesty of a movie  Now he's in Italy  appreciating our food  including people  such as Rinaldo Pazzi  Giancarlo Giannini    but comes back to the States for Clarice  Julianne Moore  and to even the score with a former victim  Mason Verger  Gary Oldman   Let me tell you  this movie does not deserve to be spoken of along with Silence Of The Lambs and Manhunter  because it's truly  completely  absolutely  totally BAD  I mean  the scene near the end with Ray Liotta's cranium being opened and him forced to eat part of his brain saut  ed  WTF  Then  why the HELL was everybody so annoying  including Clarice   And why did the story keep going nowhere  I suppose that this is the 'teen' chapter of the Hannibal series  terrible  stupid  gory for gore's sake and totally embarrassing  Don't watch it  especially if you love any other of the Hannibal movies  SOTL  Manhunter  Red Dragon  Hannibal Rising   Hannibal  1 10
