Naked Deanna Troi   Richie's brother Chuck  from  Happy Days   with a reverse mohawk  Death Wish 3 has all this and more  including one clever scene where Chuck Bronson's character sets up a mousetrap like device that brains a punk when he opens the window  Chuck also places a board with a bunch of nails on the floor near another window and smiles when he returns and sees bloody footprints leading away  All I can say about Death Wish 3 is that it is one of most incomprehensible  serious  movies that I have ever seen--loaded to the hilt with mayhem  and nearly zero police response  despite the use of military weapons to mow punks down by the score  As I understand it  Bronson disowned this film  but happily cashed the check from Golan Globus  If you enjoy quality movies  avoid this one  but if you're in for a cheap  Jackass  kind of thrill  check it out
