Have you seen all the big adventures of last few decades  If you have don't bother with this one as you've already seen most of the scenes already - and I can guarantee that those scenes were originally in much better movies  The story  I'm sure that true storytellers will never forgive me  is childish and stupid  stupid in a way that making it play in a mortuary would result in a bunch of angry walking dead   Every character is based in a clich   and    well  they're nothing but the clich    And yes  again all you need to be a hero is to be American  At least in Finland they advertised this to be the kind of movie the DVD was made for  Maybe I should sell my player then    1 10
