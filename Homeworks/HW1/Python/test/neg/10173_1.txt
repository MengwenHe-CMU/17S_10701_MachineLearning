As you can read the only good comment about this movie is made by someone who actually watch it AT HIS CHURCH    Anyway  movie had a good B movie sci-fi beginning  everything was there to make a good entertaining   easy to watch movie  then everything felt in this religious Jesus-will-save-everyone brainwashing mode  story start with 2 main characters  2 reporters but it fast give the first role to that Jesus freak who is there to save everyone's soul with this con-descendant attitude  In a few words  this movie goes from entertaining to brainwashing in about 30 minutes Waste of time  waste of money    AVOID IT
