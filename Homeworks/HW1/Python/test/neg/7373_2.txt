This is the one major problem with this film  along with a good deal of qu  becois' biggest movies  Done in a pretentious way by pretentious people  It's really sad  but  big shots  movie makers  driving Dodge Stratus     from this province believes They Got the Thruth  They Know What the Little People Like  We're not a rich province  every time a big movie like this  30 millions      is made  it's cutting off a lot of others who won't see their movie made because of lack of governmental help  So it generates mediocrity  only movies from  friends of the family  are going to be made  I sound angry and I am  I went see Nouvelle-France expecting a journey in the lives of my ancestors  but i found myself stuck in a pool of inconsistencies  french accent  we gotta please our cousins  so f    our qu  becois' language and lack of historical research is only a few  Add a campy love story and the same music score playing again and again and dumb qu  becois' viewer is gonna open up and ask for more  I'm glad this pretentious piece of s    didn't do as planned by the Dodge stratus Big Shots    It's gonna help movie makers who aren't in the very restrained  movie business  of Qu  bec  Rent Cruising Bar instead and have a real good time  PS  I'll never forgive them for ruining such an awesome title
