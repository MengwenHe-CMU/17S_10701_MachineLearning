I love the Jurassic Park movies  they are three of my all time favorite movies  And I hate this game  if there was one game I wish I never own for the Super Nintendo was this one  How can a game based on a classic movie be just too awful  And to make it worst  I was scare of this game when I was a kid  How dumb was that but then again I was a kid when this game was first out  The game play in this game is just odd  One minute it's a action game and then it's a shooter  What in the world is wrong with making up your mind when making a video game  The Sound in the game is just terrible to listen  The music is just too sick to listen to  The Controllers in the game don't work most of the time  Jurassic Park the game is just a waste of time and money and won't be a classic  Avoid at all cost
