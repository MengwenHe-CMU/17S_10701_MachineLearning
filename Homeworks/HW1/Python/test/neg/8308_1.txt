I watched DEATH MACHINES as part of BCI Eclipse' Drive-in Cult Classics  featuring Crown International Pictures releases  on DVD  As I work my way through the multiple DVD sets  I am growing to love many of Crown International's movies -- especially  the creepy  erotic  psychological thrillers   DEATH MACHINES is not one of them  After seeing movies like MALIBU BEACH  THE CREEPING TERROR and THE PINK ANGELS  it is hard to say that this is the worst film ever made  but  it doesn't have much going for it  No plot  really no story to speak of  The acting isn't evident    only the actor responsible for the terribly-played Tony  with the thick  fake Italian accent  made any attempt to  get into character    The score is annoying and pedantic  The only thing about this movie is why    what compelled the film-makers to make this film   Did they think the story of  1  three ninjas  2  two competing crime bosses  3  an ancillary bartender   karate school student character  and 4  his pitiful love-interest nurse was so compelling that the world would not be complete without this movie being made   This is a complete waste of time and money  for you  me  the producers  writers  actors  and the director
