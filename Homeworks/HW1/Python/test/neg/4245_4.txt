This movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in English history  The film version of Cromwell's growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off  This film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the Civil War was in no way Catholic versus Protestant  both sides were Protestant  Cromwell was never present at the battle of Edgehill  nor did he ever  save the day   The royalists did not win  the battle ended in a draw  As another reviewer has noted  Cromwell was certainly not one of the  Five Members  who were to be removed from the House and arrested   Overall  this movie was decent  The producers tried WAY to hard and it didn't turn out so great   definitely could have been better
