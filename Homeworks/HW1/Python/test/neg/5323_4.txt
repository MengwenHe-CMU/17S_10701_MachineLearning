Just ONCE  I would like to see Koontz's work given to a decent screenwriter  director  and producer  JUST ONCE  This is a good attempt by Jean LeClerc and Chris Sarandon  and an even better attempt by Victoria Tennant  but everything else is pure unadulterated garbage  The screenwriter should be shot for bastardizing Koontz's work this way and the director   please  The story is a well-written story  but the screenplay is quite dull  unbelievable and horribly executed  The only elements which work are the performances by LeClerc  Sarandon  and Tennant  On a personal note  I really wanted this to work  I adore Koontz's novels  but they have never given them the attention  backing  and talent they deserve  If they put the same money into Koontz's work that they shovel by the barrels-full into King's  Koontz would quickly rise above  But alas  Without powerful people who believe in his work  I fear he will never get the chance  As an adaptation to the novel  this movie was a total suck-fest  As a stand alone movie  it wasn't that bad  though extremely weak in many places with huge plot holes and terrible  stiff  unprofessional dialog which never should have made it to the final cut  This movie failed miserably to live up to its potential  Had they followed the original work by Koontz  a bit more closely  and invested a decent amount of production money  this could have been a far better endeavor  However  all I can manage to see in this  is how good it could have been  and wasn't  It rates a 4 3 10 from    the Fiend
