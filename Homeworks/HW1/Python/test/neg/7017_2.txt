I am a big fan of  Auntie Mame  with Rosalind Russell  She really was the perfect actress to play that character  I've heard Angela Lansbury was very good on stage in  Mame  but it's hard to imagine anyone topping Rosalind Russell  Lucy was such a great comedienne that her comic bits salvaged her performance in this movie where I think she was miscast Really  they should have dubbed her singing voice - hearing these songs sung at a faster tempo and with strong voices really changes the whole effect   I just saw the stage revival in Washington D C  and I think Christine Baranski was very good as Mame  Harriet Harris - the nasty chain smoking agent on Frasier - played Vera and she was particularly good  Both would be good casting for a TV movie of this show  Maybe if that production makes it to Broadway they'll consider filming it  Also I think Tracy Ullman would be good as Agnes
