2001 wasn't perhaps Eric Roberts best year  Both Raptor and this came out  Watched Raptor a while ago and really thought it sucked and being Erics worst  But that had it  s share moment of fun and D-standard  This one doesn't have a thing  Tommy Lee Thomas is the name of the probably worst actor in these days  The story lacks any punch and the whole thing feels even slower than a snail breaking in curves  The two thing that stands out are Martin Kove and Eric Roberts  You could argue about their effort being good or what but compared to the rest they are above all criticism  I say thank you Roberts see you next time  and hopefully a better one
