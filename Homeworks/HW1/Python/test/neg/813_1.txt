I had this movie given to me  and have to admit  I am glad that I did not pay money for it  The back of the box makes it seem like some kind of sex triangle  with 2 women trying to seduce her  But the reality in this movie is far from that  In reality  the main subject is the victim of a vicious and sadistic rape by the two other characters  There was absolutely nothing in this that I found interesting at all  Even movies like Silence Of The Lambs and Wild Things  which the box tries to compare this movie to  were riveting  because of the unexpected turns and suspense  But Jaded has none of this  It concentrates on the rapeists and the sick relationship with the boyfriend of one of them  And the persuit of a videotape that may prove the victims story is true  While it does show that same sex rape is possible  it is not a movie worth watching  If at all possible  pass this movie up at all costs
