Ni  as Mal is not a movie is a bad episode of a cheesy badly conceived soap opera   The acting is not a bit better of that in soap operas  I guess the writer and director has seen too many Mexican soap operas and can't conceive anything remotely different   Give it up  go back to your soap operas so that you have an audience to please   Stop waisting our time and money and giving a bad name to the once respectable Mexican film industry   It is NOT an OK or good movie  it's a mediocre soap opera
