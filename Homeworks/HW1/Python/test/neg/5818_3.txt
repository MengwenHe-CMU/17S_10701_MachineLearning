This is the story of a news investigator who hates his job - which prove why actors - even as weak as Tom Cruise and Denzel Washington - are on the big screen and your neighbors are not  I'll say this though - the better moments show some basis for being really funny  not just wacky   to keep trying  maybe taking some classes  and using the time to keep learning how to make a good movie    Dude  Where's My Car  and the  Scary Movie  sequence have it all over this     college attempt   The lighting wasn't  the production wasn't  and the script had moments  the conversation from space - very nice try unconvincingly executed    This reminded me of  Dark Star  - which is about being  lost in space  - but this movie is just lost   The talent was the bartender  he said 'dog' so annoyingly that I knew he had to be acting    wasn't he      now THAT's acting    the Mark Hammond guy  and Marty  I guess I gave the movie a point for each one of them    3 10  -LD ______________________________________________ my faith  http   www angelfire com ny5 jbc33
