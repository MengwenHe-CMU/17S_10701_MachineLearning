Sure  most of the slasher films of the 1980's were not worth the celluloid they were filmed on  but this video nightmare may well be the dullest produced  Six horny pot smoking students decide to go camping  Of course  and you know this already  they begin getting killed one by one by a mysterious stranger  The climax has a hunky forest ranger trying to get to the teens in time before the last cute girl becomes buzzard bait  John Carl Buechler  my least favorite B-movie guy  did the lousy makeup effects here  The cast features Carel Struycken  of  The Witches of Eastwick  and the Addams family movies  Sadly  he does not pop up until the very end of the film  and is covered in burn makeup  rendering him unrecognizable  Steve Bond  anyone remember him   is here in an early role as a victim  Brown's direction  and the script he cowrote  both smell like the presents brown bears leave in the woods  He pads the film with so much stock wilderness footage  I thought I accidentally rented a special episode of Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom  Much of the cast sits around the campfire and eats  then walk  and sit and eat again  The forest ranger is involved in the strangest scene ever put in a slasher film  he tells a joke about a wide mouthed frog to a baby deer  Jackie Coogan  who must have forgot he once worked with the legends of silent cinema  has two scenes  and is involved in the second strangest scene ever put in a slasher film  he and the hunky forest ranger have a conversation about cucumber and cream cheese sandwiches on oatmeal bread   yeah  There is not one minute of suspense here  The killer  a forest fire survivor looking for a mate  watches the students from behind trees  We know it is the killer because the film makers have dubbed in a heart beat sound effect that helpfully serves to wake the viewer up every few minutes  Skip this pile of pine sap and rent  Halloween   instead  This is rated  R  for physical violence  mild gun violence  gore  some profanity  brief female nudity  mild sexual content  sexual references  and drug abuse
