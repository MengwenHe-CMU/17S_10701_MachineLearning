Emraan Hashmi post MURDER did some good roles in Bhatt films but other director just made use of his kissing and naughty image AKSAR is one of them and it came after AAA  JAWANI DIWANI in a row and I was already fed up of him and such roles  The film has a nice twist at the start i felt like an Abbas Mustan film but then it turns into a routine film with sudden love  sudden jealousy and a bad climax Anant Mahadevan makes a terrible film Music is saving grace Camera-work is fabulous Emraan Hashmi just repeats his act of his earlier films and has 2 expressions throughout Dino looks stiff  talks as if he is practicing Hindi and does okay in some scenes Udita is expressionless and irritates
