My blurred childhood memories have kept the echo of the cult serie of Belph  gor in the French 60's    so I was eager to see the big screen adaptation  I should have kept my money and gone for a stroll in the Louvre  The idea of the scenario is still very apt and interesting  the fantom of Le Louvre  but the adaptation is ridiculous  The dialogues hesitate permanently between French irony and serious  American business  without achieving neither but not without sounding asinine  Acting leaves somehow to be desired and special effects are meager compared to what one could expect  low budget     What is left of all that  Not much outside a few good shots of Paris     which is seldom a disappointment  Belph  gor was worth more than that
