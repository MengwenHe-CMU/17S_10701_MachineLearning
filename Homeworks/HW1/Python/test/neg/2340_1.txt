If you are a pretentious person  it would sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality saying that you really like this movie  Otherwise  don't bother and better watch something good  This is the stereotypical movie for snobs  The plot line would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end  It is just presented in a messed up way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie look intellectual  Mullholland Drive is not enjoyable to watch  You would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it  And if you do  you would most likely be disappointed because it is not a big deal
