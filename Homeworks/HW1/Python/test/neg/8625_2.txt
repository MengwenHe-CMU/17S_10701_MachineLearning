There are just so many things wrong with this movie  Jeff Bridges weird accent  Rita's ability to crack the password code  The entire script  The ending - esp the last scene when two coffees are brought to the table for Jeff and Rita and the publisher  J   R laugh and say  We don t drink coffee anymore   Well  why did they order it then    They obviously did  If they didn't and the waiter brought everyone a coffee by default there would have been three coffees  Total Tosh
