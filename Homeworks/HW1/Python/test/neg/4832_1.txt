This is a rip-off from Cellular   Bad casting     Bad direction     Bad Music    And the list goes on    well there was no direction since story  scenes and setting were lifted straight off of other movie   Even fight sequence is copied  One with the mace was from Kill Bill and another one with fire hose was from either a Jet Li's or Jackie Chan's movie  i am not able to recall the name of this movie      Stay away from this cheap imitation and try to see the real thing     Cannot expected something original from any of the Bhatts any more
