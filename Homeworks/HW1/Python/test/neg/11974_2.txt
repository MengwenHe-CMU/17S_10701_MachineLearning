    with a 500  budget and a bottle of ketchup  If you are a fan of C movies with no talented actors whatsoever  a ridiculous story  cheap effects and lousy camera-work  this film delivers  All others be warned  You could probably make a similar movie with a couple of friends in your backyard and a home camcorder  The film is good for some laughs though  Watch it with some friends and discuss how NOT to make a movie  2 10 for unintentional comedy  Why the hell do you have to write 10 lines  I have seen comments with less lines and writing this is just a lame filler
