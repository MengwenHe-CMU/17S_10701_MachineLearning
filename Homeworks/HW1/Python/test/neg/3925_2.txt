This movie is poorly written  hard-to-follow  and features bad performances and dialog from leads Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh  The premise  believable but weak  undercover narcotics agent succumbs to the drug underworld  deserved better than this Lili Fini Zanuck flop  The competent supporting cast  Sam Elliott  William Sadler  others  was not enough to save this film  In addition  this movie also contains the absolute worst  love  scene in cinema  Moreover  the soundtrack is vastly overrated  specifically the revolting  sappy-without-substance  Tears in Heaven  by the otherwise legendary Eric Clapton   Rush  is wholly unenjoyable from beginning to end  2 of 10
