the movie is precious  and cage is a babe   but will anyone agree with me in saying that the punk representation in this movie is ATROCIOUS      where's the clash  the ramones   misfits  social distortion  the cramps   sex pistols   ANYONE         the music is this movie is incredibly disappointing  at LEAST they play the cure  plus  randy's feathered hair and pleated khakis    this definitely looks like a movie about  punks  the way that a bunch of movie industry squares see punks  although it's a 90's movie  SLC punk paints a much more accurate picture of the punk rock scene in the early 1980's  just sayin'
