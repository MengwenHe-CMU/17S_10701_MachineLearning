The only positive thing I can think of regarding this utter piece of garbage is that now I finally have a good answer ready if anyone ever asks me what the worst movie I ever saw was called  It would have taken such little effort to make it more watchable   a lot more effort and it could have been brilliant even   Why would anyone want to produce such waste   I refuse to believe that a director could be so ridiculously untalented   Making a completely intolerable movie must have been the point   Anything else just doesn't make sense
