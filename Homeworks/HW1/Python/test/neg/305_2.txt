The premise of the film was very promising - sort of a gay Napoleon Dynamite type of film  And to be fair  there were some funny moments and funny lines but it really wasn't very good overall  The script and dialog felt like a local sketch production  full of clich  s and scenes that were predictable  However  there was enough that was amusing  that I stuck around to see how it finished  since there were hints that something special happens at the end  But it seems that either the film ran out of money or the writer ran out of ideas because the ending is extremely abrupt  almost skipping directly from what looked to be the key conflict in the film to the final credits  Overall  it was very disappointing but not completely unwatchable
