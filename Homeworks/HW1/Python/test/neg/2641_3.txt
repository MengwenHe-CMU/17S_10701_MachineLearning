This  horror  movie lacks any horror or even mild suspense  Even the gore is not good  The plot would have some promise if it was done by someone who cared about what they're writing filming  but the people who made this movie obviously did not  Basically  the film proceeds in a series of fits and starts thusly  Main character insists she's not crazy   Milo  lurks about in his yellow raincoat or rides in front of a car on his bike  Main character insists she's not crazy and rambles on about her passion as a schoolteacher  Someone gets killed in an unsatisfying manner  Main character insists she's not crazy and musters up a few fake sobs  Are we seeing a pattern here  If you don't  you may enjoy this film  Otherwise  watch something else  The budget is low  low  low AND IT SHOWS  unlike say  THE EVIL DEAD  which makes you forget about its crap budget   and the acting is bad  bad  bad  with the possible exception of the janitor   In general the movie is boring  boring  boring  I can't think of a single scene that's actually done well  In fact  I disliked the movie so much I actually turned it off ten minutes before the end  something I very rarely do    heck  I watched the non-MSTied MANOS  THE CLONES  and WILD WILD WEST all the way through  3 10  Spare yourself and watch PHANTASM again
