This movie was utterly and unequivocally terrible  The plot was so predictable and boring and the script so corny and pretentious that by the end I wanted to stab my eyes with the nearest pen  Normally I don't write reviews  but I was astonished by the number of positive reviews it got  While I admit that the acting was okay at some parts  the script's deficiencies more than outweighed the decent acting  The only reason I watched this was because a few of my friends were watching it  introducing it as most likely the worst movie ever made  judging by the trailer  We were not disappointed in the least  Its only saving grace is that it contained my new favorite pickup line  BRANDON  I just want to get to know you  GIRL  You just want to get into my pants  BRANDON  I want to get into your mind  your heart  your soul  I don't see you wearing any pants in this equation  Overall  I would rate this movie as the worst movie I ever saw that took itself seriously
