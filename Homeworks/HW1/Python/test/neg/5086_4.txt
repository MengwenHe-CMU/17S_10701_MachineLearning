  Warning - this review may contain spoilers     The idea behind the character of Danny  Jet Li  is a good one - young boy is taken by hoodlum and raised to behave like a vicious pitbull  controlled mainly by whether his collar is on or off his neck  However  the writer did not know how to deliver this idea within the constraints of believability  He has Danny meeting a blind pianist  Sam  Morgan Freeman   who has to be the most trusting fool a man ever was - along with his nit-wit  endlessly babbling  rather unattractive step-daughter  Victoria  Kerry Condon   I was stunned  by the way  when I learned Victoria was supposed to be 18 - she looked 25 or 30 to me  Amazingly there is no romance between Danny and Victoria  When Danny turns up again  wounded  what does Sam do but take him straight home  Danny is out for 2 days  but do these nit-wits take him to a hospital  Nooooo  I don't know if they even called in a doctor  Now Danny is obviously not a mentally stable person  this is apparent from the get-go  yet Sam takes him into his home  where both he and his step-daughter could have been seriously harmed or even killed by this rather strange  young man  Why Morgan Freeman took this insipid role in this asinine film I can't even begin to guess  Surely Mr  Freeman is not that desperate for a paycheck  Then we have Bob Hoskins as Bart  the gangster who  owns  Danny - now you talk about a son of a gun that's hard to kill  The car Bart is in gets riddled with bullets that would have rivaled Bonnie and Clyde's demise  We think he's dead  but no  Then we have another car accident - and yet again  ol' Bart escapes unscathed  In addition to that  we also have Danny fighting half a dozen tough guys at a time  plus a scene where Danny has decided he doesn't want to fight any more  I don't care how much a person doesn't want to fight  when it is down to the wire of you fight or you die  I think anyone would fight  As I said in the subject heading - this film is about 40 miles outside the boundary of reality as we have come to know it  It's not just a case of suspending belief - it's completely beyond that  Furthermore I never did understand why Danny's mother who turns out to be a nice lady  rather than the prostitute Bart claimed she is  became mixed up with Bart and his gang and got shot  Maybe that was my fault  I got distracted right about the time that scene came on--but it seemed highly unlikely she and Bart would have ever crossed paths  4 stars out of 10 - and that's being generous
