If this is classed as 'real life' of London  then the producers must be on different planet  It is the most depressing  suicidal  dark  dingy  dross on TV  Everyone is fighting  everything has nasty under tones running through it  nothing is done for genuine reasons  If you want a real life picture of people in London or the UK  then this programme is by the farthest from reality  There is not one good word I can say about this programme  The only certainty is that will be a great big fight over Christmas dinner  Even the characters are totally unbelievable
