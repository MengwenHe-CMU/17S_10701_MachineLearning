It was dumb  Sort of like an Adam Sandler movie   There were a few funny parts but not that funny  I liked some of the actors in it though   There were some Sat  Night Live people in the movie  But I wouldn't recommend this unless there is just nothing else better on  And it was still better than any Jennifer Lopez movie
