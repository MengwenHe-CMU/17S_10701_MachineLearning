The characters was as unoriginal it hurts  The little skinny dorky computer geek  the funny African-American with stupid clisch   punchlines  cool white guy with a compassion for cars and the handsome leader who ends up with the pretty girl  The actors is at best mediocre  Ecsept from Norton who does a pretty good job as the bad guy   The rest of the movie is also stupid and a total waste of time  Its all in all about a group of spoiled boys using the world as their playground where every safe in a big house is what keeps them with food on the table  I mean  why work for a living when you can rob people  AND    Who the f     messes with the traffic lights in a major European city    And in the middle of the FRIGGIN day   Think of all the damages and not to say deaths among innocent civilians  What about all the ambulances and firetrucks   I created NO compassion for the main characters  and weather Mr Wahlberg gets his bloody gold or not  i could not give less of a fart
