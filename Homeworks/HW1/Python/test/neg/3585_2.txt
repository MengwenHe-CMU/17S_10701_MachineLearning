Egads  I used to think Keannu Reeves was the worst actor in Hollywood  I not so sure anymore  Willy gives Keannu some stiff competition with his  I'm made of plaster  performance in this movie  Combine that with the fact that there is almost no plot  and not a single likable character  and it's pretty hard to recommend this turkey  Natasha tries her best  but even Julia Roberts couldn't save this flick from obscurity  Avoid it unless it's really late and there's nothing else on  -Oh heck  in that case just read a book
