I was duped as well  Here I was expecting all sorts of man eating Pirahnas and what the hell do you get  An hour and a half of nothing  but awkward silences with some weird guy  who isn't weird enough to be scary  I thought there was no way  5 could be too much for a movie  Damn I was sooooo wrong  It was very hard to watch the whole thing  Don't fool yourself  Its not so good that its bad  Its not even that kind of movie  Its nothing  an hour and a half of absolutely nothing  PIECE OF CRAP
