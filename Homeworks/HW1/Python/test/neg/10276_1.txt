Not even Emeril Lagasse cooking can save this disjointed  overheaded idiotic nonsense  starring emeril lagasse as a TV chef from the food channel who with help of the crew to try to make the show better  poor plot and stupid script throw this show down the drain  Robert Urich wasted in the poorly supporting role and sadly this was his last one ever R I P     This is the worst show of 2001 and it will be on the list of the worst shows of this decade  I Feel Very Sorry for Emeril Lagasse for making this sitcom  he even said himself it stunk  It's hard to believe that they are the same producers of designing women that did this mess  TV Review  1 Star
