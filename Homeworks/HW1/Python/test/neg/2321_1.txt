Absolutely inane film starring Abbott and Costello  Even our young children would become increasingly annoyed with this complete mess of a film  Abbott as Dinklepuss  What a look he had on his face  Sure  he had to be part of this dreadful film  Did anyone notice that Costello's mother in the film sounded and looked like Fay Bainter  Luckily  for Ms  Bainter  that she wasn't in the film  There is really no excitement hear for children  The jokes  if any  are quite stale  Some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous
