I was really looking forward to this movie but sadly it didn't live up to expectation  A good movie has the audience identifying empathising sympathising with the main actor  Unfortunately this was very hard to do with Samantha Morton  The storyline seemed very disjointed and didn't flow as it should could have done  Keifer Sutherland appeared to be little more than window dressing and made me wonder why he agreed to play what appeared to be a bit part  Beautiful scenery and the acting of Tem Morrison and Cliff Curtis was about the only plus  Maybe by being a kiwi I set the bar higher for locally made films  Maybe the change of director  supposedly hard to work with main actor has biased my opinion  Maybe I'm just trying to make excuses for a movie which could have been great  A lot of maybes which still does not explain why this movie just lacked anything special  It could have been great  it wasn't
