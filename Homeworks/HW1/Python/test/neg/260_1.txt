K Murli Mohan Rao made the much better BANDHAN in 1998 This film is an awful remake of THE WEDDING SINGER Basically in short  the film consists of  Salman Khan who in those days used to have the role of a dejected lover who looses his girl and also he had his comic scenes where he hammed badly even today he does well he does it all here too and also looses his shirt in scenes Jackie Shroff- wasted  bored and tired  his role is so stupid He is shown as a lover of Pooja Bhatra then in 1 scene he is shown as a womanizer  Inder Kumar- confusing characterization again Rani Mukherjee- boring  overweight and does nothing special Pooja Bhatra- tall  fair and actress worthy but lacks talent Kashmira Shah- says a dial as if a poetry Mohinish Behl- poor fellow the 2 kids were awful too The story is the same and has awful comic scenes  a sudden love story and boring drunken scenes plus a forced comic track of Shakti Kapoor Direction is poor Music is decent Salman khan just goes through the motions  Jackie is bad  Rani is as usual  Pooja is bad  Mohinish and Kashmira are nothing great Inder is awful
