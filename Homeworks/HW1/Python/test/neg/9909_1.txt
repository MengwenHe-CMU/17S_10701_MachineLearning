Contains Major Spoilers  on the off chance you would actually care about the story line  OK  we have storms that destroy a city and a computer hacker who clobbers the power grid  Predictable schlock from the start  and if that weren't enough  the 5 second action bumps between the movie and the commercials kill what little suspense there might have been  For example  will they make it to the airport in time  Things look dim as we go to a commercial  and the action shot before the ad shows them bouncing around inside the plane  Well  I guess they're gonna make it after all  but then again  they had to because they're good guys  The acting wasn't any too impressive  exception and welcome relief  Randy Quaid as Tornado Tommy    the effects were kinda lame  the bad guys got it  and the good guys came through  The real disaster of this movie was the script  especially the ending  Not only did they wrap things up happily as quickly as a soap opera given 24 hours notice of a cancellation  but they glorified the hacker as well-intentioned  So he caused a bazillion deaths  he meant well  And  of course  an uplifting final TV report about people coming together  Barf  It was everything I expected from the commercials  and I'm glad I wasted my time watching it  It will make great conversation at the lunch table tomorrow  Is CBS insulting us by making this  Sure  but we watched it  didn't we  Did you count many ads there were for home backup generators during this pig  Here's hoping for the next Plan 9 from Outer Space  which gets better with each viewing   This isn't it  1 star
