L'Humanit   is a murder mystery  These movies tend to be popular  and the 6 9 rating it currently has suggests that it has been  too  Unfortunately  this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever  A few non-spoilers  for instance  include a 5-minute scene wherein the main character eats an apple  And another 3 minutes where he breathes  In case you were wondering  this is not  in fact  art  Neither is it a commentary on humanity  which from the title it seems it is trying to be  It is  in fact  boring  There are numerous attempts in this movie to say something about humanity  One might think to onesself   How would I comment on humanity   And the most obvious and boring answers will of course be sex  love  and death  Not that these options are uninteresting when done well - just that they are the canonical options  For sex  this movie does its best to make it unattractive and disgusting  In your first five minutes - hence this is not a spoiler - you will see the bloodied vagina of a murdered 11-year-old girl  it's a murder mystery  remember  Later on  a few people throw themselves at each other and have what the director would like us to believe is  raw  sex  but in reality it's contrived and overly symbolic - but worse yet  uninterestingly so  I enjoy being disturbed by movies  This movie showed me why  Disturbing movies usually show something inside of someone  their humanity  which they did not know existed and are a bit scared of  L'Humanit   tried to do just this and failed  and I walked out of the theatre not disturbed  but disgusted  thinking that I had wasted my time in the theater  despite having seen the movie for free
