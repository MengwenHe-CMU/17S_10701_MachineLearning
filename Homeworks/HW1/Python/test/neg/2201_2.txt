SPOILER ALERT     I don't go into 'high tech' movies expecting them to be 100  accurate on all things computer related  But somehow  even the average 'I have a computer' user is supposed to believe that  1  A computer professional with a top secret  special data 2  is going to keep the primary copy of said data on a 1 44 floppy 3  and make absolutely NO BACKUP of this special secret data Even high school students back up their homework for goodness sake  Also this is the worst represntation of a computer nerd ever  Even though she is super cute we are supposed to believe that she has no friends  neighbors  extended family  or coworkers who can identify her  Even the unabomber had a family that could turn him in  END SPOILER These aren't just minor mistakes that had no bearing on the movie - These are the major plot points that fueled the storyline  The characterization was awful  the plot wholly unbeleivable  and if you haven't seen this  don't bother
