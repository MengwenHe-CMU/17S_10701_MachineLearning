As bad as they get  This film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters  The two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would end  This film is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel   Put in highbrow language  this film lacks verisimilitude  People  not even people from Ohio  simply do not act like this  Well  maybe the writers do  There is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearable  F903
