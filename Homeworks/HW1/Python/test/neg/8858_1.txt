If you watched Pulp Fiction don't see this movie  This movie is NOT funny  This is the worst parody movie ever  This is a poor attempt of parody films  The cast is bad  The film is bad  This is one of the worst pictures ever made  I do not recommend Plump Fiction  I prefer the original Pulp Fiction by the great Quentin Tarantino  This is one of the worst parody films ever made  Plump Fiction is not a good movie  It is not funny  It is so dumb and vulgar
