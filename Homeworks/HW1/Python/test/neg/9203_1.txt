1  Bad acting  2  For a bunch of castaways on an alien planet  it sure looked like home  especially with the houses and roads you can glimpse in the background  3  Terrible plot with stupid caracters making idiotic decisions and blithely losing precious survival equipment and clothing left  right and center  4  Cool 70's scifi jumpsuits  possibly the only good thing about this movie  5  Interesting ship at the beginning  this crew must have been watching Space 1999 a lot   Too bad it blows up so early  The escape ship also got sunk too fast   sigh  6  Anthropologists might find some aspects of the movie interesting in terms of primate group behavior
