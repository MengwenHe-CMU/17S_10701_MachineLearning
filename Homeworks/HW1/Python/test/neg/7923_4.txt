Movies like these do not need sequels  Part of the advantage of Don Bluth moving away from Disney is that he didn't need to suffer their endless tirade of straight-to-video  poorly animated cash-in sequels  But apparently it was someone's brilliant idea to make a sequel to  All Dogs Go to Heaven   so we get this  Charlie Sheen replaces Burt and he's not really as good  Most of the film is just a poor excuse for a sequel and it isn't nearly as dark  different or entertaining as the original  I feel sorry for future generations who are going to have to suffer endless sequels like this without ever knowing what it was like to have a time when Hollywood didn't totally rely on successful films as a crutch to release banal crap  Please  no more sequels to kids films that don't need 'em
