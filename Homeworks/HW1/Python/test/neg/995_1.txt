I think Downey was perhaps inspired by French new-wave  Who wasn't  Unfortunately  what he ended up creating here was more along the lines of crackhead new-wave  A synapse is obviously a terrible thing to lose and Downey appears to have lost plenty   Just say no  indeed  In more ways than one  Including to watching this film  I couldn't bear it after a while and began fast forwarding through it  It would have been wiser to have just skipped it altogether
