My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first came out  There were only 3 couples there and we all walked out about the same time  This is the only movie I have ever walked out on  It was just painful to sit through  The theater actually stopped us on the way out and asked if we wanted a refund  Never had that happen before or since Pleae do not rent this You will really regret it I am really sureprised by the vote summary Perhaps personal tast has something to do with it
