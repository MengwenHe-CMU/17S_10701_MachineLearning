This was the most unrealistic movie I ever seen  I can't believe that the writer and director didn't see that almost all the movie looks like a SF one  For example   1  It is impossible for the killer to stay on cold glaze and after 10 hours to get up so quickly  2  You can't get electrocuted trough a water pipe like in the movie  believe me  it's my domain  3  With a saw you can cut 10 pipes in 10 hour very easy  Let's say that the chain was made from steel but the water pipe was rusty and it was made from iron  4  If you try to cut your foot with a saw you faint  in the best case  it's more likely to die because your hart fails  before to get to the bone shin   And there are more other examples
