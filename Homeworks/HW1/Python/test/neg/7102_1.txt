Why Lori Petty was cast as tank girl  I'll never know  Her acting performance is lack-luster  Her voice is grating  It's almost impossible for me to put into words how bad this movie is  There are several  modern-pop  references in the film  which I found to be very strange  given that the movie was supposed to take place far in the future  It wouldn't have been hard to make this premise interesting either  Some better writing would have helped loads  Naomi Watts makes an appearance in it as a mild mannered techno-geek  I think they should have probably switched roles  I'll never know why anyone would like this movie  unless they were a Petty fan  Try not to see this movie  Total waste of time
