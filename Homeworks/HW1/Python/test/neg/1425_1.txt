Not since  8 Heads in a Duffel Bag  and the  How High  previews have I laughed so little at something that the film makers thought would be hysterical  Jerry Lewis is the richest man in the world  He is rejected as 4-F by the army  and decides to use his money to raise his own army- of about half a dozen  He then impersonates a Nazi commander in Italy  and eventually tries to kill Hitler  That is the description of the flimsy plot  This film is as funny as a heart attack  This film makes  Hogan's Heroes  look like Shakespeare  If the money men of  The Producers  had really wanted to lose their cash  they should have shown this film  I cannot stress how bad this thing is  Lewis' direction consists of two different cameras shooting the action from two different angles  then being edited together  This sitcom type of direction works on television  but here it is an obvious attempt to cheat the audience  He ends most of his scenes with a still shot  as if giving the viewer a chance to double over in stitches before going to the next tired set up  I spent most of the movie doubled over in abdominal agony  accompanied with severe flatulence  over this thing  Lewis  the director and producer  sets the film in 1943  but makes no attempt to use period costumes or sets  Everyone wears the latest style and has the latest interior design   for 1970  The supporting cast is lost as Lewis goes off on his patented tangents  which last as long as major surgery and are just as painful to watch  When Lewis becomes the Nazi commander  he spends the last half of the film screaming at the top of his lungs in a performance so odious as to stink up any good will you try to bring in at the beginning  The final embarassing shot has Lewis and his cronies trying to put one over on the Japanese  They wear buck teeth  squint their eyes  and talk in a  funny  accent  It may be one of the most blatantly racist occurrences since the internment camps  I was slack jawed at what Lewis did through this whole thing  but that put me over the edge  Watch for Kaye Ballard's very tasteless scene where she tries to attempt suicide over and over again   Star Trek 's George Takei has two small scenes  then wisely drops out of the picture  This has less laughs than Mel Brooks' last three films combined  There is nothing sadder than watching a formerly respected comedian screw up a project so horribly  you actually feel ashamed for them  Jim Carrey learned that with  The Majestic   but Jerry Lewis still shows up on television once in a while pulling the same unfunny schtick  I feel sorry for him   Which Way to the Front   is cheap  unfunny  offensive  and stupid  I feel bad for everyone involved  and anyone who must endure this  I do not recommend it  Though rated  G   this contains some physical violence  some gun violence  and some adult situations  If your child shows interest in seeing this  please consult professional help
