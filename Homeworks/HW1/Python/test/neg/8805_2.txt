I normally am a glutton for poor movies  but this thing stunk  Do not watch this movie  Terrible effects and very little humour  what the hell was the point of making this movie  No gore to speak of and no acting to speak of  I could only manage 45 minutes of this rat dropping of a movie  and that is rare for me  Something positive to say about this drivel  cover art was OK  I am pretty sure the movie has a ending too  even tho I did not make it to it  The rats were unorganized and blew their lines constantly they lacked intensity and seemed just to be going through the paces for their paycheque  The actors were worse
