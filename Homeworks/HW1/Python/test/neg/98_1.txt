 Never ever take a film just for its good looking title  Although it all starts well  the film suffers the same imperfections you see in B-films  Its like at a certain moment the writer does not any more how to end the film  so he ends it in a way nobody suspects it thinking this way he is ingenious  A film to be listed on top of the garbage list
