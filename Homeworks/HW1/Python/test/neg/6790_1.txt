This series is formulaic and boring  The episodes are the same thing every week  simply with slightly varied settings  Some purely evil character does some dastardly deed  Walker goes after him  and it ends in a Karate match  The villains are super-clich   super-stereotypical evil villains  the good guys are all pure  honest and saintly  and the story lines are simplistic and unrealistic  After about 2 episodes  the show becomes totally unwatchable by all but the least discerning fans  Certainly not Norris's best work  His other work may be clich   but it usually does not drag on for weeks  If you enjoy formulaic boring  repetitive clich  d snooze-fests  then this is for you
