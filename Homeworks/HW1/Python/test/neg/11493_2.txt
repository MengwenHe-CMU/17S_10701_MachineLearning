This is the perfect example of how a great book is turned into a poor film  The direction just gives the impression that the film was made up as they went along and Patrick Swaze is so wooden you can almost see the puppet strings on his body  Spy Vs Spy films are not - or should not - be about car chases and shootings  the bad guys in this movies are really bad shots and miss the main characters even when at point blank range  Even the action shots are just a clich   with the usual mounting sidewalks and crashing through tables and chairs - yawn  I got half way through and switched off - completely bored
