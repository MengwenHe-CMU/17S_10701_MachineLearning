I have watched this movie quite bemused  I am not sure whether it was attempting to be a horror gore fest in a Rob Zombie type affair or an exploration of real events  In either case it missed its mark  It's not particularly historically accurate with characters being chopped and changed for the sake of the story   The performances were neither compelling nor bad  For me  I would have preferred a more psychological approach and this film could easily have gone down this route without spoiling the overall effect
