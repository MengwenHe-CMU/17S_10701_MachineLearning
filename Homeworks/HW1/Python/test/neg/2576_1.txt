 POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT  It's unlikely that Seagal will ever again scale the heights of lousitude he did with  On Deadly Ground   mainly because no one's ever going to let him direct again   but he sure tries  don't he  This one's a typically brainless and badly-written little fantasy about how Indian folk remedies are much more effective than Western medicine  Seagal seems to actually believe this nonsense  although he never explains why life expectancy in the Americas and Europe is so much higher than it was in 1492  Kinda like he never explains how his supposed  water-fueled engines  work in  On Deadly Ground   Even the  action  in this one sucks
