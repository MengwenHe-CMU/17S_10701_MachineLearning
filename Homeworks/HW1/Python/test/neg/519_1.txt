This film has to rank down there with Ed Wood films  A terrible script and bad  bad acting  A machine gun fight in front of plate glass windows  minutes go by before anyone is hit and nobody has cover - not one window ever breaks  You'd think after a fire fight like that the big U-Haul truck might be riddled - not a scratch  Do CIA agents and government contractors  shout  Top Secret information at a stand-up cocktail party with hundreds of people around  There isn't one actor you care about  everyone is shallow and basically unlikable  A Hawaii bound 747 flies out of Los Angeles and crashes twenty minutes later in the Pacific     in 100 feet of water      A short time passes when the stewardess announces to the five other passengers they only have two hours of air left  on a 747  The next day the rescue teams show-up and amazingly the six passengers are still alive  A movie that starts out mediocre and goes from bad to worse
