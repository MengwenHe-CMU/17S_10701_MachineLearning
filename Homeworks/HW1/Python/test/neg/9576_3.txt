Deformed  aged female scientist kills fellow scientist in order to steal formulae for rejuvenating cells and reversing the aging process  She takes it and turns into the beautiful  evil Satanik  Magda Konopka  who goes around  seducing and murdering wealthy businessmen  She dresses very stylishly in late-60s mod clothes and manipulates those around her  looking a lot like the late Marisa Mell from the DIABOLIK film  Coincidence   However  in spite of all this  it's amateurish and sloppy without the James Bond pop-art gadgetry that DIABOLIK had had  Even the Madrid and Lake Geneva filming locations don't make up for this  The soundtrack is by Manuel Parada   Roberto Pregadio and it isn't bad at all  consisting of lush orchestration with a little fuzz guitar used as an embellishment  Perfect for one of those European Loungecore CDs that came out in the 90s  The Retromedia DVD also uses a substandard grainy color print that's in poor shape  with an explanation at the beginning saying that this was due to the age of the film  Bull   They either didn't bother looking for a better source or they couldn't find one at all  There are only a few stills of Magda and that's it  Sloppy   poor all around  this one gets a 3 out of 10
