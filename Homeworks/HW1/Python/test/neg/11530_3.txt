Badly shot  badly edited  clumsy dialogue  flat characters  unsuccessful adaption of a novel  It doesn't really get much worse  Decent acting and good popcorn saved me for this hour and a half - felt more like three hours - of boredom  Occasional good one-liners  David is a dim-witted young man  who has never recovered from losing his brother at an early age  He puts his faith in a Chinese philosophy mumbo jumbo video  although that doesn't seem to help him much in real life  David is a member of a debt-collectors gang  where every member has an IQ below sea level  A lacking script  along with uncreative shooting and even worse editing  make what could have been quite funny incidents of failed debt-collecting look like a amateurish homemade reality show  David rents an apartment from an elementary school teacher  Haraldur  who by dropping a couple of sentences about his own importance convinces David he is dealing with the most dangerous criminal in Iceland  A severely lacking script doesn't offer David anything to base his opinion on  A couple of scenes SHOWING Haraldur doing something that David could have misinterpreted would have done the work  The potentials of film as media  as opposed to the text of the book this film is based on  are not exploited  At first  David's connection with Haraldur raises his status within the debt-collectors gang  but the prevailing paranoia in the criminal world forces David to show where his loyalty lies  The plot of the film is fine  but then it is based on the book  This could have been a much better film  A good screenwriter could have made something of this material  Sadly  that is not the case  The acting is generally good  P  tur J  hann is excellent and credible as David  Eggert   orleifsson doesn't get much to work with  but does his best with what little material he has  Ingvar Sigur  sson and Michael Imperioli  in a tiny role  manage alright  Overall opinion  What could have been quite a funny and entertaining film about a dim-witted anti-hero in a debt-collectors gang  becomes a boring  badly-crafted film made after a poor manuscript  Staring at your toes for an hour and a half would be more enjoyable
