Eh  This is a popcorn movie  nothing more  I watched this with a bunch of friends  and though that might NOT be the best way to view a horror movie     and most of the dialogue and action was laughable  It left me yearning for a real film     The main problem is the lack of tension in the film  It keeps flashing back to 'explanation' scenes  which dissipates any discernible tension  And the character relationship 'twists'  Yeah  they suck  I won't say what they are  but they just don't add anything to the film storyline   By relationship  I mean the two main characters   Eek  My recommendation is this  watch this movie if you can't think of anything better  Mediocre at best   Maybe not even that
