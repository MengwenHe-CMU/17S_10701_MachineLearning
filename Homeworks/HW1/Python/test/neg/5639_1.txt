As I'm listening to my parents watch this  after I gave up 10 minutes into the film   they have absolutely no idea what is going on  When  Charles Dickens  stared into the camera  I half expected him to turn into a demon  yes  he looked like one   Unfortunately  that didn't happen  This movie had various reasons I did not finish it  one  it was unbearably slow  I mean  seriously  it was SLOWW  You can only understand 10  of what is said  and the characters were poorly introduced  If you have an English accent and you like a LOTTT of talking  no action  terrible acting  cheesy laughs  and the same music sound effects played over and over and over  then this is THE movie for you    1 10 - completely horrible  Avoid at all costs
