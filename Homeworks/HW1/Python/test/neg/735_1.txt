Awful  dreadful  terrible  The actors are bad  the music is ridiculous and the filming pathetic  I rented the DVD and had to force myself to watch it until the end  My advice  read the book  it is much better and you won't have to put up with all these silly images and ridiculous dreams Catherine has  I think I have never watched such a bad movie
