   SPOILERS       SPOILERS    What's going on here   Barbara Hershey  looking decidedly unsexy - as if she'd stolen her granny's spare wig - puts in an unconvincing performance as a woman who kills the wife of a man she has had an affair with 'in self defence' after hitting her forty odd times with an axe  Like Lizzy Borden  she is acquitted but after the most unconvincing argument ever presented to a jury by the representative of a supposedly 'innocent' defendant I have ever seen  Lizzy Borden took an axe and gave her father forty whacks When she saw what she'd done - she pleaded self defence I don't think so I find the defendants guilty of screening an unconvincing portrayal and have no alternative but to award this film a sentence of 4 out of 10  which would have been lower but for the previous good behaviour of some of those involved
