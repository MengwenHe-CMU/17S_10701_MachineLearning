This movie was  unfortunately  terrible  Clich  d  hackneyed  stilted dialogue and acting make it almost unwatchable  The feel-good finale is laughably lame  There is a reason Judge Reinhold's career has vanished  If you don't live in New York  and aren't Jewish  several of the jokes will be inscrutable  I  too  found the need to have the unacknowledged lesbian daughter go straight at the end quite insulting  I simply cannot fathom how this film was so popular at film fests  It is  without a doubt  one of the worst films I have seen in quite some time
