Two stars  Amanda Plummer looking like a young version of her father  Christopher Plummer in drag  stars in this film along with Robert Forster--who really should have put a little shoe black on top of that bald spot  I've never seen Amanda Plummer in a good film  She always plays these slightly wacky characters in films that don't quite add up  and she does so yet again in this one  Firstly  we have two young women  sisters  who don't resemble in the slightest  who allow themselves to be picked up  separately  by questionable men along the roadways  Amanda's character  Sandra  does at least have a good reason for allowing Dr  Jake  Robert Forster to pick her up in the first place  She has been run off the road  seemingly by a maniac  and her car is pretty much destroyed  Warning - Spoilers ahead   However  as we go along  we realize Dr  Jake is not playing with a full deck any more than Amanda is  He makes every decision based on the flip of a coin  When Dr  Jake and Amanda arrive at a motel  who do we see but the maniac's car  and what does Amanda do but get inside his station wagon and start snooping around  What her motive was for doing this is never clear considering the man is apparently dangerous and might try to kill her  One would think the last thing she would do is place herself in such a precarious situation  Not only does she snoop around  but she finds some money and takes it  Shortly after this we have several other things that don't add up  Dr  Jake  with Amanda as his passenger  runs out of gas  and the two of them abandon his car and begin walking  One would think crossing a desert  he would have checked his gas gauge--this seems a very unlikely thing for him to allow to happen  Then later  he is seen driving the same car  When or how did he get the car back   Dr  Jake tells Amanda he knows she has taken the money  Now how would he know that  He didn't see her do it as far as I know  and she didn't tell him she did it  Then later we have a character named Santini  David Thewlis   the man who was driving the station wagon  give the two of them a lift and I'll be darned if he doesn't know Amanda took the money as well  How would he know that   It loses credibility at an alarming rate the further we go  When Alice  Amanda's sister  Fairuza Balk gets in the clutches of the killer and decides her fate on the toss of a coin - one would think she would be very  very careful that the coin she swaps for a trick coin would definitely be the trick coin - but apparently it isn't  It's jarring things like this  that destroy any credibility this movie may have had
