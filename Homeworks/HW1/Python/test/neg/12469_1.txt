Basic structure of a story  Beginning  Middle  End  Sometimes this structure is played with  and we get Memento or Irreversible and the story plays backwards  Sometimes it's just not linear  a la Pulp Fiction  Regardless  they all have a beginning  middle and end  This is the first film I have ever seen that doesn't have an end  Beginning  Girl's best friend is expelled  Middle  Girl needs to cope without best friend  End  Non existent  Not that having an end would've saved this film  but at least it would have been complete  It's an exercise in apathy  we get a party-mix of characters  and they all turn out to be duds  Boring  vain  vapid and pallid imitations of people  And here's the action within this film  NOTHING HAPPENS  Nothing at all happens  Mischa Barton tries to talk with a plummy English accent  Dominique Swain whines a lot and Brad Renfro receives a blow job from some old guy  End of movie  By the time the credits rolled  I had a horrible feeling that many prisoners must feel  periods of time  those precious minutes of our life  have just been wasted  The only passable point  and that is a very emphatic ONLY  is Brad Renfro  He acts well  Lacey Chabert I tend to like  but no luck here  Due to good work in other films  I will forgive Mischa Barton this travesty  but I hope all cast members were slapped in the face for their involvement  Please  I implore you  Avoid  Don't fool yourself into thinking  I'll make up my own mind   My sister told me to never see this  and I ignored her  wanting to make up my own mind  That was a bad decision  I have never hated a film  There are many I don't like  but I have never hated a film  Until I saw this
