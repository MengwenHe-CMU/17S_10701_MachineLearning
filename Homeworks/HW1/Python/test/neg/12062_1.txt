Idiots go camping and act like idiots before they finally die like idiots  yes Camp Blood  or if you're wanting an awful  badder than bad pun that suits a badder than bad film   Camp Bloody awful    is so bad it's actually quite depressing to watch  And it has all the ingredients to be a perfectly bad film     Awful acting-check  Bad script-check  Tacky effects-check no originality whatsoever-double check   It doesn't even attempt to be different  and is riddled with every predicted clich   imaginable  For example  the film opens to a couple having sex in the woods  so of course they end up dead   One of the most disturbing things is that this film actually spawned two sequels  how and why only baffles the mind   Just stay away from this one
