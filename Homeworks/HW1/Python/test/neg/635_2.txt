Watching ALIEN EXPRESS inspired feelings of awe  shock  pity and  yes  sheer terror  To think that actors who have done good work in the past should come to something like this  The horror  the horror  Tell me if any of this sounds familiar  A train especially built for a political campaign is on it's way to Las Vegas for a big rally for the candidate  a Senator from Texas  Barry Corbin  the only actor with roles both ALIEN EXPRESS and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN in the same decade   At a railroad crossing in Utah a meteor incinerates a car waiting for the train to pass  The train stops  Local law enforcement is summoned  Oh  can it be  The Senator has a lovely young lady  Amy Locane from CRY-BABY and MELROSE PLACE  who just happened to have once been married to one of the officers answering the 911 call  Lou Diamond Phillips  STAND AND DELIVER  LA BAMBA  is the ex-husband  Meanwhile eeeeevil aliens have managed to stow away on the train  The train leaves  Lou gets his buddy to pilot a helicopter so that Lou can drop onto the moving train  about 70 miles per hour  so that he can save the day  As the buddy's reward  he crashes the helicopter into the mountain  Which is another example of how poorly written ALIEN EXPRESS is  The cop hero's sidekick must die  we all know that  But he's supposed to die near the end of the third act  usually while saving several lives  Once on the train  Lou manages to lose his shirt so that he can channel Bruce Willis in DIE HARD by wearing a wife beater t-shirt  Yeah  Lou is 46 years old but he hits the gym  The part he's playing isn't worth bothering with  but he's in good shape  The Senator is going to have an afternoon delight with Miss Utah  but aliens intercede and both he and the woman young enough to be his granddaughter pay the ultimate price  Soon we have bomb threats  multiplying aliens  and of course the train goes out of control and speeds toward its date with destiny while Lou and Todd Bridges  DIFF'RENT STROKES  try to save as many lives as they can  There is exactly one surprise in the entire movie  Early in the story a couple lift wine glasses to their thirty-fifth anniversary  with hopes for thirty-five more years together  The dude gets banged up  but he and the Mrs  both live  Maybe the writers just lost track of them  This is the kind of movie that you'd love to be a fly on the wall  These actors who have done better work  and  really  deserve much better than this  are probably just happy for the work  Did they actually think they were working on something worthwhile  or did they cry  and or drink  themselves to sleep at night  At the end of the story the  fairly numerous  all things considered  survivors gather in the last car of the train  which is unhooked  The other cars go over a cliff but the one containing the protagonists stops just inches short of the cliff  Lou and his ex are reunited  Happiness reigns  I'd have thought that the first thing they'd do was get off the train so they'd have solid ground under their feet  but I digress  Someone looks out the window and sees a shooting star  Look  make a wish  Then another  Then more and more  The Earth is being bombarded with meteors that will crack open and creepy crawly hand puppets with big teeth will be everywhere  It's gotten to a point that seeing the words  The Sci-Fi Channel Presents  on an  original  movie tells us that we'll be glad we have Ti-Vo so that we can fast forward through the next two hours  Or  better yet  just go ahead and erase it two minutes into the story and spend that time more wisely
