I'm Mike Sedlak  I co-wrote the score for this movie  And proud of it   And I love all of the comments  Some have not gone far enough  The movie premiered in San Francisco in the summer of 1973  The theater was packed with friends and family  We all clapped  Five days latter  it was pulled from all of the screens in the Bay Area  If anyone is interested hearing some of scene by scene details  which might make the movie even more enjoyable  please let me know  We could start with the shot where Gideon Blake throws the toilet plunger to distract one of the evil henchmen guarding the radio transmitter on the deck of Bud's house   Or how Gideon diffused the bomb in the original version  Didn't help  It still bombed  Bring it on
