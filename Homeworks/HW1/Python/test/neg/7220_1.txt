This television show  is a idiotic waste of time if you want to learn about animals watch the discovery channel  If you want to watch nincompoops on television just watch MTV  MTV stands for music television not nitwit D-listers preforming retarded skits or bratty kids crying their hearts out for not getting a BMW for there 16th birthday  I bet that if you like this show I bet you love viva la Bam  and jackass huh  I think my IQ dropped ten points watching this show   This is a combination of two shows jackass and the animal planet Some people think this is a good combination  I on the other hand think it is retardant  And if you notice its a lot like jackass and viva la Bam just a note  this show is horrible
