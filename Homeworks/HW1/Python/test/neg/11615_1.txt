The most self-indulgent movie I have every had the misfortune to rent  Unwatchable  Much of the movie is obviously improvised  and not well  It looks like Toback took the first take of everything  The movie gets good for a couple of minutes when Robert Downey Jr  shows up  then goes to hell again real quickly
