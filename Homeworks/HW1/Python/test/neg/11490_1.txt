I have not seen and heard the original version  I am no Russian  but I am learning right now  I also have no preferences for Russia  Bulgaia  the US etc  But what I have to mention is  In the German synchronisation in the whole film all Russians speak with Russian accent  Americans talk  Hochdeutsch   without accent   I have never heard such a stupidity  Besides  this is boring  I hope the original is better  The rest is a simple thriller  not really good ideas  Like a cheap version of a James Bond film
