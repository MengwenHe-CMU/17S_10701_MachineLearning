This plot had more holes in it than an OJ Simpson alibi   I noticed two Star Trek references in the movie and  yet  ironically we have a lead character played by Andy Garcia who is the antithesis of the Vulcan philosophy of   The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few or one    Let's just say that while trying to save his son from cancer he puts most of the rest of San Francisco at incredible risk  Michael Keaton's character is almost as unrealistic as well  He neglects to kill at numerous opportunities and yet is angered when Garcia foils his attempt to kill a bunch of cops at once  The child's doctor remains in charge of her faculties even after been held hostage several times in a short expanse of time but put her on a wide walkway 5 stories up and she loses it   Andy Garcia's child is something of an anathema in this movie  He is the most sympathetic and real character  one of the movie's bright spots  He furthermore utters a line  that must have been the result of serendipity  regarding fighting cancer that parallels Keaton's motivation to escape  All in all  the movie was not a complete waste  see From Dusk to Dawn 2  Texas Blood Money for that  but disappointing considering the talent on hand
