This series continues to frustrate and annoy  How are they going to drag this out for another year  Each episode offers up more and more questions  whilst providing the answers to very few  To quote another very popular website  I believe that this show has now jumped the shark  Will  I keep watching it  Probably  Will they manage to keep the show on-air till it ends  Probably not    How did two qualified doctors fail to notice that Naomi was still alive  How did 30 plus people not notice a corpse wake up and walk off with a knife still in her back  How did someone have enough strength to create two trails and climb up a tree to ambush Kate  We've now introduced a ghostbuster    Same time next week  yep
