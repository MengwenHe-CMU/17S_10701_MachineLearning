This film derives from a Long Running ITV sitcom by the same name The Sitcom lasted for half a decade roughly and brought to our screens Rigsby Phillip Alan Mrs Jones   Vienna  Then in 1980 The film version hit the Cinemas Now when it did sadly Richard Beckinsale had passed away   was replaced by Only when i laugh actor Chris Strauli  I myself felt this gave the film a different feel I would have preferred if it wasn't shot as Richard was a key character Thats like having the porridge film without Godber or Mackay  The Film did have some classics moments definitely but it felt a bit De-Ja-Vu  Many parts were seen before in the TV Series  Now if you saw the movie first rather than the Series you would get a different feeling about it then the series fan  Saying that Leonard is definitely on top form and makes the movie just like in the TV series The Film has recently had a new lease of life on DVD and is usually on Terrestrial over a quiet weekend It is a cracking good film but for Rigsby fans you may feel that youv'e seen it similarly before  Saying that though its worth a buying watching 7 8 10
