All of the great horror movies of the 70's  80's  and even the early 90's from Psycho  to Texas Chainsaw Masacre  The original not that warmed over WB crap   to Silence of the Lambs  The characters in these movies were based upon the crimes of Ed Gein  The writers and directors tapped into the true story for the inspiration for creating some of the greatest  fictional  movie killers of all time  The old horror films were great because even though the crimes were loosely based upon the facts of the case of Ed Gein  they were truly fictional and far removed from the true story  In the case of this movie  they've created a fictional horror film in which they tried to capitalize on the true story in order to sell a cheap  poorly acted  love story between two characters that nobody really cares about  In fact  in a  good  horror film these two characters would have been excellent victims  End of Lecture    In short  this film was like wearing clammy underwear on a cold afternoon sipping on a nice cup of chilled vomit
