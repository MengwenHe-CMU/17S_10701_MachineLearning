Boring as hell and kind of a chick flick  It's the story of a neurotic woman who struggles with the concept of marriage as a business arrangement  the romantic nature of a one night stand  and the uncertainty and pitfalls of true love  Many of the story's motifs are reminiscent of other recent KST movies  e g  the English Patient   but have far less appeal  After the first half-hour I started checking my watch  wondering if I'd make it home in time to catch Leno on tv  I passed up  Gladiator  to see this
