I usually really enjoy Steven Seagal movies  They are usually highly entertaining and being somewhat of an adept of Aikido  I usually like the way Steven incorporates these martial art techniques in the fight sequences  However this film is a really bad movie making effort and it seems obvious to me that the blame lies with the director and the producers who obviously have no idea how to make an action movie  let alone direct someone like Steven Seagal and to take advantage of his knowledge and competence  I never saw the end of this movie  I walked out before the end simply because I couldn't stand watching anymore of this bad movie  I am sure that many people also share my feelings
