As an avid cinema go-er i felt that whilst i was ranking my favourite movies i felt it only fair to rank my most hated films  I'm afraid i really have nothing positive to say about this movie  It is in fact one of only two films that i have ever walked out on  In fairness I went back and watched the movie again to give it another chance and sat through it only to wish that i should have stayed away  The sad thing is the movie has a really decent cast and crew   but then even the brightest stars in Hollywood cant bring a dead duck of a script to life  Stay away   Save yourself from this truly woeful 'film' 1 10
