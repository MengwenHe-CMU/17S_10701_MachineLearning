What could possibly go wrong with a movie that includes a bunch of Italians pretending to be Flordians  and some vague-lava-octopus-crustacean-thingy as the hell-induced hellspawn-devil-fish     Everything is what goes wrong I tell you  This is a very good MST3K episode because the heckling in right on the ball  which without fault  is easy to do considering this movie is a piece of junk with a lousy and boring plot  9 10 for MSTied version  1 10 for un-MSTied version
