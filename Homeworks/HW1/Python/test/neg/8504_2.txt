I give this movie 2 stars purely because of its slightly liberal plot line  Without going into too much detail  The acting in this movie is terrible  Really terrible - wooden  shallow  The graffiti on show is weak  so bloody weak that I can only wonder why they bothered to use graffiti artists at all  IT was obvious in the spraying scenes that they'd gotten other people in to do the 'work'  They might as well have let the actors do the painting and saved themselves a few cents  I would avoid this film at all costs  The kid loco soundtrack used to be something I listened to on my iPod  its going to be a while before I can go back there for fear of this movie coming back into my mind  Avoid at all costs  Unless you are thinking to yourself  Wow  its been a while since I've seen a really sh t movie
