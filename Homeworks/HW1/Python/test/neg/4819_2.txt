New Orleans is nothing like how it is portrayed in this debacle of a film  Quaid's attempt at speaking with a cajun accent  by the way  hardly anyone speaks that way in New Orleans  is terrible  Plot   elementary and mindless  This picture refers to itself as a mystery  but a mystery involves a gradual process whereby a viewer is given clues and twists throughout a film  There's none of that here   Big Easy  tries to get by on trite New Orleans stereotypes   Don't be fooled - the real Big Easy is nothing like the town that Quaid   Barkin bumble their way through
