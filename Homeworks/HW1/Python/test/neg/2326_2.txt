I bought the video for   13 at HMV  we pay more in Britain  as a friend had told me it was highly rated and the reviews on this site were generally impressive  I have to say that the opening credits were a let down   the dancing music not very powerful  The car ride and unexpected crash just as the lady passenger was going to be harmed was a nice touch   something unexpected   though the way she walked away from the car with hair perfectly groomed and still carrying a handbag looked corny for most Directors   but for Lynch was something else  Her dazed walking around after such a shock was enhanced by a regular low noise similar to fingers scraping along a blackboard  I thought another Lynch master touch perhaps portraying the demons gnawing into her shocked and traumatised self conscious  After a while this noise became somewhat annoying and on further investigation I discovered the new video cassette squeaked  I dont know whether this squeak took away a lot of my enjoyment but this movie became a waste of time  and money  The two female characters had some presence and the lesbian scenes were fair enough  though predictable  There were no male characters of any merit and apart from a few vaguely good scenes  the hoover switching on  there were far too many dreadful scenes that were plain weak and ridiculous  Eg  the coffee being spat into the napkin by the menacing loon and the silly monster face at the back of the diner  Oh and what about the paint in the wifes jewels  boring and naff  This whole film gives you the feel of the failed genius  you know when you listen to the worst Dylan track ever and think my God that was embarrassing    was that really Bob  The whole feel is that of a failed TV movie   badly put together with a few  not many  extra bits to give it a 15 rating  I whizzed it on during the last 30 minutes   Do I give it another chance and watch again  If I want to be puzzled and work hard at understanding a film I will watch Frank Woods Guide to Consolidated Accounting  Lynch did one classic   Blue Velvet and Straight Story was nice  This  like Wild at Heart  was a let down   his weirdness is now predictable and stale  Anybody want to buy a 2nd hand video  Make way for some younger original talent  David  Four out of Ten  and no more   Sorry
