at a Saturday matinee in my home town  I went with an older friend  he was about 12  and my mom let me go because she thought the film would be OK  it's rated G   I was assaulted by loud music  STRANGE images  no plot and a stubborn refusal to make ANY sense  We left halfway through because we were bored  frustrated and our ears hurt   I saw it 22 years later in a revival theatre  My opinion had changed--it's even WORSE  Basically everything I hated about it was still there and the film was VERY 60s   and has dated badly  I got all the little in-jokes   too bad they weren't funny  The constant shifts in tone got quickly annoying and there's absolutely nothing to get a firm grip on  Some people will love this  I found it frustrating   by the end of the film I felt like throwing something heavy at the screen  Also  all the Monkees songs in this movie SUCK  and I DO like them   For ex-hippies only   or if you're stoned  I give this a 1
