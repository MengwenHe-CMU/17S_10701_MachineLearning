Gordon Scott made some good Tarzan movies  but this is not one of them  As I watched it  wincing at the bad  obviously interior sets and the hollow wooden  clonking  sounds as they walked across supposedly dirt trails  and cringing at the bad dialog and worse acting among the supporting cast  I kept thinking   Sheesh  This is TV show level   Then I find out it was  indeed  three TV show pilot episodes woven seam-fully into one  It's nice to see Scott get outside  alone   away from the lame sets  in a few of the scenes  and the fights do have some pretty nice moves    but oh  ow  and ouch as to the dialog  And did I mention the acting  Heck  Cheetah  or  Cheta   in this version  was a better actor than most of the humans  And that's not saying much  It is kind of a stitch to see a younger Sherman  i e  Scatman  Carothers acting as a native  But probably not worth the overall time-investment
