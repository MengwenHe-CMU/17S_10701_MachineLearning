This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the  very protracted  end   The plot is confused and laboured  the actors have a couldn't care less attitude  maybe they were paid in advance - bad move  or knew they weren't going to get paid   and the sets were featureless  boring and cheap  I fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then  More unrecoverable life time wasted  If you must watch it  then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once  But maybe you'll need an antidepressant instead  Sometimes it's good if celluloid degrades
