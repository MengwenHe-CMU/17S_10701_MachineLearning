What can I say about this  Such a big Prestige-Production - but in the End  Wasted Time  wasted Money  This work a disaster is historically seen  Only some examples    Augustus often is named 'Gaius' - his First name  Pronomen   But the old Romans don't used this Name  Correct would be the Surname  Nomen Gentile and Cognomen  or the 'Octavian'  'Caesar'  'Augustus'    Livia was shown as tyrannic Wife  But this historically wrong    Iulia was shown as nice young woman - but she wasn't one  Adultery and  maybe   Prostitution and arrogant behavior was the cause of her banishing    She wasn't at the dying bed of her Father  She never was allowed to leave her banishing  And she was at this time around 50 years old  Not as young as she was shown  In the same Year Augustus died she committed suicide  because Tiberius stopped giving her a Pension    Augustus was much more scruplesless then in this Movie shown  But Author and Director seems to believe Augustus' own 'Res Gestae'  What remains  Historically extremely doubtful  bad acting  bad built and equipment - 2 Points out of 10 - one for Peter O'Toole
