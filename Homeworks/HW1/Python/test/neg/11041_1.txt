     Classic     Excellent    Good   Fair  Tragic Review  Oldboy is not for everyone  It's pervasive violence  its live octopus eating and it's unimaginary story  The film focuses around a man who's been kidnapped and is imprisoned for 15 years  Oh Dae-Su is released  only to find that he must find his captor in 5 days  Now the story though may seem gripping to start with but once watching this bloated and un-original blood fest it develops into a mash of bitter blood and a forceful film  It's directing is on par of average and by no means the standards of what a South Korean thriller should be  Oldboys acting scenes are paralleled with dull humour and a poorly writtern script  Oldboy is occasionlly presented with thin straw performances that one could only feel shameful about  Verdict  Not for everyone but it's scope and vision isn't clear enough to see further than the grey abyss of fog   Tragic
