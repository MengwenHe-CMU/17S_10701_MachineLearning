I was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week He told me it was so bad that I had to see it  So I went on an auction site and bought the film  This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen  It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't  Terrible acting and terrible storyline  Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson   I still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see  Van Peebles is a joke in this film  Robots cant bluff    PSYCHE  I have to say though the special effects are actually amazing    PSYCHE  DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad
