I watched the first show of each series just to see and what a waste of time  The girl from Emmerdale she was fat so yeah she should be in fat friend but no one every lost weigh  Like Itv made a big mistake with this  Bad Girls is 100times better  I feel that the whole show was just about large people trying to loose weight but never did then they tried to have love storyline oh my god what a a waste of time and also air time  This show has not been repeated on ITV2 3 4 yeah thats how good it is  I would say do not by th box sets just a waste of money  BEWARE
