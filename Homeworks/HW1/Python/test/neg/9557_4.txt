The movie was supposed to release in 2002 and was much awaited due to the promos but it finally released in 2003 after the producer died The movie is good in parts but overall isn't great The scenes between Rani and Ajay are okay but the other scenes are not well handled The film is too similar to BOLLYWOOD Hollywood and though this was planned before that got released first so originality is lost Milan Luthria disappoints overall after KACHCHE DAAGE Music is good but too many songs Ajay Devgan looks jaded and his appearance gives away that the film was delayed and his acting looks boring too Rani is good Sonali is good too rest are okay
