This is not a good film  I can usually sit through a Van Damme movie if I have to  as they are usually a bit of a laugh and don't require much thought  This one has no redeeming features   It has a distinct lack of plot  humour  acting  direction etc etc  A real stinker on all levels   I have never walked out of a cinema during a movie  although I came damme close here   Avoid at all costs
