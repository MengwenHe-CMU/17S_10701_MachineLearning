This appalling piece of tripe was  conveniently  loosely based on a true story that involved two family members of mine  played by Jack Thompson and Jacqueline Mackenzie   This film is offensive  besides the fact that it wasn't a particular good film anyway  it does not in any way capture what it was like to lose such a close family member and completely omits those who were really affected by the true-life tragedy  As for the director  he managed to cash in on a family's misfortune for the price of a Porsche  If I could have given this a zero I would have  Avoid this film at all costs
