This movie was nothing like the book   Everything was mixed up or changed  Most of the movie was things that weren't even in the book  This movie never should have been viewed  It was a great disappointment to me when I enjoyed the book so much and then to watch how this movie trashed the entire thing  I would never recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of Nora Roberts or J D  Robb  Honestly this movie is not worth watching with how off from the book is really is
