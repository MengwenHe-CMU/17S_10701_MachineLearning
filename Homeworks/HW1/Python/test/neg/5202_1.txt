This is an awful movie from just about every point of view  Since much has been already pointed out in previous reviews  let me just focus on  Serbs  and  Delta Force  guys in this movie  1  The uniforms that  Serbs  wear are not Serbian  And helmets are wrong  too  2  The actors who play  Serbs  are not speaking Serbian  not even a language close to Serbian  unlike in  Behind enemy lines  where the Czech actors did their best to speak the language and add at least a bit of credibility to the movie  3  The gray-bearded  Serbian general  looks and acts like a moron  firing his gun whenever US soldiers call his name   - US soldier   Gravic  Give up   - Gray-bearded moronic general   fires his AK47  - US soldier   Gravic  Come out   - GBMG   fires his AK47  - US soldier   Gravic  You're surrounded  - GBMG   fires his AK47  - Prop guy   Excuse me  Mr  gray-bearded moronic general  see  we're out of blanks and I sent the boy to buy some more  but he's not back yet     - GBMG   click  4  Since when does the Army issue AK47s to the Delta Force  I guess they couldn't find enough working M4s in Bulgaria  but there were plenty of old AK47s and practice blanks    Maybe they should have went for some airsofts  they are cheaper and wouldn't have hurt the credibility of the movie anyway    5  In the scene where a DF officer is hanging on a rope while talking to a rocket scientist  he is holding his finger on the trigger all the time  No sane person with any weapons training or just plain common sense would ever do that  I guess the actor figured that his coolness level increases the longer he holds the gun that way   This movie is such an insult to common sense
