I felt like I was watching an example of how not to make a movie  I think the director filmed it in his back yard  There was no real plot   Terrible script  Terrible acting  The worst production I have ever witnessed  A couple of bad CG effects and then the rest of the movies was spent walking around in what looked like a junk yard  I don't normally write reviews to movies but was moved to warn everyone about this one  Life is to short to waste your time with this movie
