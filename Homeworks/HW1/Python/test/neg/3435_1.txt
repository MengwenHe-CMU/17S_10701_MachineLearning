Ten years ago I really wanted to see this movie on the cinema  But I missed it  and then forgot about it  Oh boy  am I glad this movie didn't get to ruin my teenage eyes back then  I saw it yesterday  and seriously  this must be among the 10 worst movies ever made  And I'm talking about movies which has had too much attention  such as those wonderful trailers on TV  and too much money spent on actors and the making of the movie  The script sucks and the acting sucks even worse  do I need to say more  Please  Hollywood  NO MORE ARNOLD
