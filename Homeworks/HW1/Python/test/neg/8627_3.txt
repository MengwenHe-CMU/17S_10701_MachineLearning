A real insult to the original  Spoorloos   which is one of the most genuinely disturbing films  and I intend this as a compliment   I have seen in the last years  Where the original is chilling and brilliant  the remake is flat and even boring  especially the  happy end  finale takes away what little suspense there was in this film in the first place  While such a distortion  especially grafting a  happy end  which wasn't there previously  is quite frequently the case in  Hollywood  remakes of European art-house movies and could've been expected  the biggest disappointment lies in the fact that this inane mess was created by the very same filmmaker who did the original  Spoorloos     Why Mr  Sluizer decided to ruin his masterpiece in such a fashion is beyond me  Avoid this abomination at all cost  as it might spoil the original for you even if watched  after  that  let alone the other way round
