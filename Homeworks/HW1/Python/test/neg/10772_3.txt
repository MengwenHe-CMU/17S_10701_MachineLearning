Having read the books and seen the 1982 Anthony Andrews Jane Seymour version  I have to say that this is not good at all  According to the books  Percy is supposed to be a seemingly foppish aristocrat when he's being Percy  and witty and clever when he's being the Pimpernel  but here he just looks bored as Percy and mean as the Pimpernel  Marguerite is supposed to be the most beautiful woman in Europe  not a tired and frumpy-looking matron  she looks middle-aged  probably due to bad make-up   Richard E  Grant has done much better things  and Elizabeth McGovern's acting is uninspired and flat  The wit and dash of the books and the Andrews Seymour film is here replaced by brawn and flashy editing that just don't make the cut    I might add that to a person who hasn't seen any previous version or read the book  it would probably look ok
