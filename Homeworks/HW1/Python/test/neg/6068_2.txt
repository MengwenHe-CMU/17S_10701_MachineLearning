For a movie I was really looking forward to  I was very disappointed  I had no expectations of this being another Amadeus  but did expect a more significant portrayal of Beethovens last years  The performance by Ed Harris was superb  but the story line was so weak that the film simply moved from one dreary scene to the next with no continuity  The only enjoyable part of the film for me was the performance of the 9th  and from that point on I could quite happily have walked out without finishing  I left feeling very dissatisfied and still have the feeling that something important was missed
