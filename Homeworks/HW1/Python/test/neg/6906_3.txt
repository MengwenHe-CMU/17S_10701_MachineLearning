I took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and I would NOT recommend it for children their age   This movie had many fighting scenes throughout it  which I found too violent and my children found scary   The subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon geared towards children  I was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this  but it just did not cut it  If you have children under 7 years old  I would not recommend this movie  Also  the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie
