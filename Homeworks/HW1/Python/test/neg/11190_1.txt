A man kicks a dog 2' in the air  A woman kicks a cow out of her bed  A man kicks a violin down the sidewalk  A woman sucks on a statue's toe for 15 seconds  A man kicks a blind man in the stomach  Jesus rapes a young girl  There you have it  I just saved you an hour of your life  Surely there are those to whom this  shocking vanguard of cinematic expression  would appeal  But I found it no different from the puerile  disconnected videos I used to shoot with my friends in the 9th grade  Except we never had a real cow  Having heard endless sermons from beard-stroking art connaisseurs of how this is such an important film  I thought it would be worth my time  Make no mistake  this is crap  If I hear one more person call Bu  uel the  father of cinematic Surrealism   I think I'm going to punch someone  If anything  he issued a major step backward from the Surrealist beginnings pioneered by his seniors Fritz Lang  Metropolis   F W  Murnau  Faust  and Robert Weine  Caligari  10 years earlier  This made a joke out of the whole thing  as if Bu  uel didn't have the confidence to truly embrace the art sans sarcasm  sans l'absurdit    It would take Bu  uel another 40 years before he would refine his style into something admirable  Skip the early stuff and hop straight to 1970 if you want to be more impressed by his work  I'm sure he would agree  In 1977  Bu  uel himself stated that he would happily burn all the prints of his old movies  In this case I would be happy to pour the lighter fluid
