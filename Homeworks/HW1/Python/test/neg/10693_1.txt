Odious Chuck Norris decided to put one final nail in the coffin containing his film career before going to the safe world of CBS Saturday night carnage with this hysterically bad supernatural actioner  For such a dumb movie this thing sure is plotty  Norris is Chicago cop Frank Shatter  First off  what kind of last name is  Shatter   Have you ever met any Shatters  Genforum com has no listing for the last name Shatter  which opens up any half clever viewer to replace the  a  in Shatter with an  i   He and his partner  Calvin Jackson  do the same old buddy cop routine you have seen before  make funny with the pimps  and make their captain mad  Jackson  looking like the theoretical love child of Whoopi Goldberg and Rick James  quickly wears on the nerves with his constant complaining and Eddie Murphy-patented facial expressions  Shatter and Calvin become involved with an emissary of Satan  whom we are introduced to in the too long opening scenes  Prosatano is a demon who is locked in a crypt by King Richard the Lionhearted  The demon's scepter  from which he gets his power  is busted into nine pieces and hid in nine different parts of the world by holy men  In 1951  some grave robbers accidentally let Prosatano out and he begins collecting the nine pieces  He disguises himself as an antiquities professor named Lockley and always happens to be giving a lecture where a holy man is killed and a piece of the scepter is taken  Norris brings in his  Walker  Texas Blunder  cohort Sheree Wilson  who plays Lockley's assistant  She helps Norris with his investigation  they make goo goo eyes at each other  and our intrepid investigators travel to Israel after a rabbi is killed in Chicago  While in Israel  Calvin is given even more to complain about  the heat  the lack of restaurant accomodations  the lousy drivers  and the fact that he is missing the Chicago Bulls playoff games  Norris even manages to work a cute Israeli kid into this nightmare  Bezi steals Calvin's wallet  and hangs around the men  leading them around Israel and not arousing any sort of appropriate suspicion  Eventually  Lockley  Prosatano  assembles all of the scepter pieces  but needs the blood of royalty to complete the ceremony and call up the devil  Where to find royal blood  Well  Sheree's father is a duke  She has an American accent but she is the screenwriters' convenient method of forcing this monstrosity toward its inevitable conclusion  Sure  this minion of Satan may have killed countless hundreds over the years  but how is he gonna do against a good old fashioned American butt kickin'  After Prosatano has been vanquished  killed by his own scepter  I envied him  he did not have to watch Bezi steal Calvin's wallet again   we are treated to an awful coda involving a bearded man who has been watching Shutter  I mean Shatter  and Calvin on their quest  You see  it was foretold   somewhere   that two warriors from the west would defeat Prosatano  The silent bearded man who watched over the couple was none other than Jesus   I kid you not  He is listed as  Prophet  in the end credits  but you and even your pets will recognize the subtle Christian reference the film makers are trying to exhibit here  Like in  I Use a Walker  Texas Ranger   Norris is aging and cannot get into his fight scenes too much anymore  He kicks a lot  and people fly over furniture in slow motion  and then Norris gives all of his line readings in that monotone voice of his  Oh  what a real director might be able to fashion out of him  His brother  Aaron  who has directed him in other films as well  has no sense of story or momentum  Scenes are thrown in for ego's sake  not to entertain  The scenes when the dynamic duo first meet Bezi drag on and on  and then Bezi is not all that important to the rest of the film  The film was shot on location in Israel  which means the Americans could insult the Israelis in person  There is not one likeable Israeli character here  The Israeli police captain is a jerk  The cops' driver does not know English  and Calvin convinces him that the word  sh tty  is a compliment  Nothing funnier than mocking those stupid foreigners on their home turf  especially when all this racist humor is coming from an American minority who would have been more than offended if the tables were turned and the Israeli cop was mocking the African-American cop in Chicago  This film is badly written  badly acted  and badly directed  It does not work as action  cop drama  or even horror  It just shows that the now defunct Cannon Studios was willing to throw their money into anything  no matter how badly it was planned   Hellbound  is surely a most adequate title  I disliked this movie intensely  This is rated  R  for physical violence  gun violence  strong profanity  some sexual references  and some adult situations
