 The beginning might be a spoiler      The Eye 2  is the sequel to  The Eye   It's about a pregnant woman who is able to see ghosts and spirits after an incident happened to her  The sound effects scared the hell out of me though momentarily but that's the only scary thing  Some of the scenes from the prequel are comparatively similar and repeated so the chilling effects certainly have chilled    The Eye  has quite a frightening and indelible impression whereas  The Eye 2  is a forgettable horror-cum-drama film  Omit watching this  Watching  The Eye  is good enough
