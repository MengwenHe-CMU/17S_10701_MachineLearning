This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen  The plot revolves around a man named Luther who wears metal dentures  bites people on the neck  and walks around clucking like a chicken without the flapping of the arms  He also thinks he's a chicken  Sounds bizarre right  Well  to me  the more bizarre and weird the person is  the better  The more gore  the better and so on  The movie starts out with the board deciding if they want to release this maniac from their institution  They mention that he has created some dentures in prison that he used to bite people on the neck  He also clucks like a chicken and THINKS he's a chicken  If I had a patient like this  there is no way I would release him  First  Luther heads to the supermarket and attacks an old woman on a bench and walks away  Then  he sneaks in the back seat of a woman's car and she drives all the way to her home  While at the house  Luther ties up the woman to the bed  When the woman's daughter and her daughter's boyfriend come home  Luther hides  Later through the film  a cop comes to the front door and asks about the mother  You can clearly see the daughter is scared out of her mind and crying but the officer keeps asking if everything is okay  She replies that everything is fine  The officer finally gets in his car and leaves  If I saw a woman constantly crying and looking scared  I would want to at least get inside the house to investigate a little  The ending is stupid as well  While the woman in in the barn  she starts clucking and gets Luther excited so he starts walking around flapping his arms and clucking like a maniac  She finally shoots him and just sits there for a minute before finally clucking some more  Then the credits roll  This is one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen  NOTHING happens at the woman's house  NOTHING  I sometimes like campy films but this one really bored me  I give this movie 1 star out of 10  Good idea  bad direction
