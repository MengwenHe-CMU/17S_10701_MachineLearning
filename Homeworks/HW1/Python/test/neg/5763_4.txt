 Curse of the Forty-Niner  doesn't really deserve a long and detailed review  so I'll just make some random observations about it  - Cool opening credits  - No plot  - Is there anyone who's ever seen a horror film before and can't guess  within the first 20 minutes  who will survive and who will not among this group of walking stereotypes  - Hey  that newcomer  Alexandra Ford  is pretty hot  - Richard Lynch  made-up to look about 100 years old  and John Phillip Law have fun  tongue-in-cheek cameos  - Karen Black has a bigger role  but she's not fun - she's rather embarrassing  - Martin Kove is on-screen for about 40 seconds  but still got his name on the video cover  Did they pay him for this appearance or was it the other way around   - I hate cheap computer-generated effects in horror films   1 2 out of 4
