First  I like S Segal  But in this movie  he has hit rock bottom and started to dig  THE PLOT What plot  Very strange and unbeliveable plot  THE ACTIONS WAY below Segals standards  THE GOOD PARTS Mr Segal is a pro  And shows it  That's it  SUMMARY I could write  and have done so  a better script for Mr Segal  In case you read this Stephen  mail me  I'll give you a better script to do a better movie  The only realistic part is the one where     see spoiler part   SPOILER PART  stop reading here if you plan to see the movie   - - - Gas leak  Wow  Disecting a 'Black-box'-recorder in a hotel room  I work in the industry  laughable  The bad guy 'get's away'  that much is true in life
