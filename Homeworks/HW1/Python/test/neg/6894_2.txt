 This film is great  I watched it with some friends and we thought it was proof that a film doesn't have to see commercial success to be a hit      is what I would love to be able to say about this film  In the words of the film itself  you are very very bad   I went to see an unlicensed acupuncturist once so generally agree with the moral of the film though  i'd include a spoiler  but the lack of plot makes this very tricky  overall  a cinematic disaster  quotes  'you're not a leper at all ' 'you're beautiful  and i bet you're nice too' 'have you ever seen a naked man's body ' 'you couldn't break a piece of straw ' cameos in dubbing  Micheal cane x3  harold bishop  steve erwine  benjamin netinyahoo  yoda
