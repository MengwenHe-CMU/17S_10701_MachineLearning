Im warning you people out there  this is just a waste of your time  I am being honest when I'm saying that this is the worst movie I've ever seen  Its just a move about Christian propaganda  Don't throw away your life  don't see it  I think they made the movie so more people will believe in Jesus or something  but it works in the opposite way  The actors are all newbies  the story is just fuzzy  I think this movie is a work of the devil   This movie is just not worth seeing  so please take my advice and don't
