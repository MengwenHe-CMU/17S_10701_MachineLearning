This film is definitely up there with the worst films I've ever seen  probably in my top 5 of worst films  I laughed once and that was when  EVAN   im building something  Evan's Secretary   i hope its a barber shop  That was literally the only time i laughed in this 'comedy'  awful compared to Bruce almighty which as a big Jim carrey fan   wasn't even that great   This movie lacked the humour of having God's powers and was more about family bonding  Id class it solely as a family movie  definitely not a family comedy   Seeing a bird poo on someone's shirt is not hilarious  neither is a beard that grows back instant  I didn't even think the special effects were great  the animals looked really stuck on  it was like watching a film which hadn't been 'glued' together properly 2 10 film - avoid
