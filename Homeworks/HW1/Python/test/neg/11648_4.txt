The plot was not good  The special effects weren't  The acting was    not very good at all  Like others  I felt there were numerous holes in the plot that you could fly  well  a space shuttle through  I thought the ending was rather unbelievable  By the way guys  about the  blow torch in space   Blow torches have their own supply of oxygen  Hence the name  Oxy-Acetylene torch    Two hoses run from the torch  One to an acetylene bottle and one to an oxygen bottle  So a  blow torch  would work just fine in space
