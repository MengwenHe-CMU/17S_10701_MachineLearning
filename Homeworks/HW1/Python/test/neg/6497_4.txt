I saw this ego-centric  effort  at achieving a film of  epic  status in the company of several native Russian family members  Five people gave 5 different reactions  from Mikhalkov worship to my cynicism  I saw a movie that looked like Mikhalkov took a lot of  Canal    money  put some of it in his  and other's  pockets and turned the project over to a bunch of film students  I counted at least 4 different  styles  in the movie  There is no way that the same director is responsible for these different scenes  Contrast these for yourself    Cadets polishing shoes with a dog    Train station scene  saying goodbye to Andrei     Outdoor panorama shots    Ormond talking through the keyhole    Initial attempt on the Grand Duke and later chase scenes to get Andrei back to sing in Figaro    Fencing sequence Julia Ormond is faster than superman  Learning about his transfer belatedly  she gets all the way across Moscow in one minute to say goodbye to Andrei  The Russian natives felt that the impression given of Russian life was  caricature  and not history  They called it  tourist postcard  Russia  They were all proud that a Russian director producer fixer has managed to break into the  big time  and be able to waste over 30 million dollars of other people's money while maybe putting a little into local pockets during filming  If you want to  think  you have seen Russia go see this movie  Drink some coffee before you go
