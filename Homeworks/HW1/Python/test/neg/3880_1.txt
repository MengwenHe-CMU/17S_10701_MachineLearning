Rs 30 - is all I paid as rent for the DVD of the movie and believe me it is not worth it  Bollywood directors think that showing fools is funny  well it is not  Please grow up  Here goes a dialog from the movie -'AGAR TUM LADKEE KO IJJAT DOGE TO LADKEE TUMHE APNI IJJAT DEGI'  Plot is useless  criminals and police alike running after fools  That is it  BHAGAM BHAG  Well it lived the title  I had to run away from it     I switched over to Star Movies and watched Home Alone 2 instead  and had a good laugh
