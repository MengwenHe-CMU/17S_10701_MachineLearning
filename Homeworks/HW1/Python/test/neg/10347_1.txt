Hard to believe - but it is  I shouldn't be surprised  Commercials try to show how unique and  funny  a show can be  Yet not only didn't the commercials announcing this new show have the slightest iota of humor to me  I've not spoken with anyone who found the commercials amusing  either  I don't recall ever seeing a pilot so devoid of cleverness  cuteness or humor  The characters were insufferable for the most part  Especially Selma Blair's  which is astonishing she would agree to be in a fecal sample of a show like this   The few moments where the characters were slightly redeemable were considerably hackneyed and trite  Rare is the show with no redeemable qualities at all  And this is not one of them  Kath and Kim has exactly ONE redeeming quality - and that's Selma Blair  Despite wearing repugnant outfits and acting like a pitiful  whiny stupid excuse for a young woman who seems like a cross between Britney Spears  Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian  Selma is still nice to look at  But if you want to look at Selma  go rent Hellboy  You'll at least maintain a modicum of respect for her instead of searing this abominable character into your brain to associate with her  All in all  Kath and Kim is a waste and truly epitomizes the worst that TV is or ever has been  It sets a new low
