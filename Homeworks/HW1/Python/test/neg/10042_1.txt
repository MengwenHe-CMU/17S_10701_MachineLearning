I love ghost stories and I will sit through a movie til it's end  even if I'm not really enjoying it  I rarely feel like I wasted my time    BUT  this adaptation of the Bell Witch story was horrible   It wasn't scary in the least bit  What is with the comic relief moments  The dialog was tedious  Acting inconsistent The movie was WAY too long and some scenes were unnecessarily drawn out in my open   Like the birthday party  The only good think I can think about mentioning is the costumes and props were well done  I am curious about other adaptation  but until then  I will stick to reading about the story
