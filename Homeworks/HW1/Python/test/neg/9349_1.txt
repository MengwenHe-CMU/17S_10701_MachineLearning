I like the  Star Wars  series  I like a good  cheapo sci-fi flick every once in a while  too  Heck  I even like the Roger Corman-produced nickel-and-dime jobbies  I do NOT like  The Ice Pirates   though   For one  it just looks too cheap  you know  For a movie that's supposed to take place in outer space  it feels cramped and closed-in like it's being filmed in the front seat of someone's Mazda  And the special effects  while appropriately cheesy  look more than anything like foam rubber painted metallic gray  Usually  I don't let things like that bother me  especially if the story and the characters are worthwhile  They ain't  The whole storyline  about these ne'er-do-well space pirates who decide to find a planet loaded with ice they can melt down and sell as water  a hot commodity in the future  I guess  is about as original as the jokes  which is not a compliment  The humor comes in at about crotch-level  like that castrating machine you'll see early on   and everyone seems to have a cranky attitude  And who told John Matuzak that he was funny  Whoever did  shame on them  Good old Robert Urich tries  but he's a reliable actor on board a badly sinking ship  or starship  in this case    I watched this one about three times and ended up feeling the same way every time - shanghaied  No stars  In spite of of the presence of Huston  one year prior to  Prizzi's Honor   and Carradine  at the tail end of a once-lofty career   these  Pirates  should walk the plank
