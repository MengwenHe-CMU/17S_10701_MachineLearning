A friend of mine showed me this film yesterday  and I was really amazed that someone could make a movie this terrible   Mix the most awful  clich  d dialog  with the most wooden acting you've ever seen  with the cheesiest special effects know to man  and you get this magnificent beast  'Vampire Assassins' is funnier than most comedies I've seen  it really is awful   I was in stitches during the scene where the ex cop vampire assassin character is having coffee with the internet journalist  Just watch it and you'll see what I mean  I honestly can't believe that someone made this with serious intentions  Tragic  but a really good laugh  It has to be seen to be believed
