Maybe I saw a cleaned up version  but other than a few flashes of breasts  I'm not sure what over the top nudity these other commenters are referring to  All in all not as bad as I was expecting by the previous comments  although the end leaves you wondering     WTF  It was dark  but not so much that you couldn't make out the scenes  and I think it just added to the creepiness and the terror of the situation  Film quality could have been better  but the acting was pretty decent  All in all a decently creepy  and yes  brutal  movie with a disappointing ending
