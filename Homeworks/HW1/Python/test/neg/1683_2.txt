I jumped for joy to learn this show ended  This show's characters were extremely irritating  None of them had one singing redeeming quality  Damon Wayans is probably the most standable one  Kisha Campbell is    Kisha Campbell  She's just as annoying as she was in Martin  The kids are all very annoying as well  The oldest is an idiot  the oldest girl is a stuck up brat  and the youngest is frustrating to listen to  I guess I did like the intelligent little boy  But that's about it  It did the world a favor by ending  Let's pray that a Wayan never stars in another show    EVER
