I saw this film yesterday on TV  I had just finished reading the book in which the movie was supposedly based  In the opening credits it said  This is a free adaptation of E  a de Queir  s' novel   I should have turned off my TV at that moment  Vera Sacramento's idea of  free adaptation  is turning a story about Church's influence over people and the hypocrisy of people claiming morality at the end of the 19th century into a story about sex  In fact  the only thing she adopted from the novel was the sex part  which was only mildly referred in E  a de Queir  s' novel  And  of course  the name of some characters  As of the characters  in the novel  Am  lia and Jo  o Eduardo were victims of church's influence  Am  lia was seduced by Father Amaro and all the time she was controlled by him  Jo  o Eduardo  her fianc    was excommungated by the priests  because he dared to criticize them  In this movie  Am  lia seduces every one she meets and Father Amaro is just another victim  Jo  o Eduardo is a dealer of drugs and illegal weapons  Vera Sacramento has turned a novel which criticized moral costumes of an epoch and turned it into just another movie with lots of  bad  sex  Even worse  her story was completely empty of ideas  Two wasted hours  E  a de Queir  s surely did not deserve this
