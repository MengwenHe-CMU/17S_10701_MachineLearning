Ohhhh MAN this movie is awful   This kind of tripe is what gives Canadian Cinema a bad name  or no name  Well  to be fair  I guess most Canadian movies give Canadian Cinema a bad name  Next to the characters  there's a couple that are the most grating in movie history   the most annoying thing is the editing and pace of the movie  It's like a drunken snail making its way to die  Thank goodness Melanie Doane is nice to look at  She's the only thing that kept me watching  Unfortunately  the rest of the movie kept interrupting  Good for a laugh  though  if you're having a bad Canadian Movie night  though  Did I mention Melanie Doane  The only good point  too bad they didn't have the sense to keep the camera on her for more than a blink at a time   Another addition in the Canadian Hall of Stinking Movies
