First  what is really great about this movie   - Ryan Reynolds  great acting  There are very few actors I really like and for now he is one of them  He has an amazing skill to impersonate characters   - The soundtrack  Very good music played at the right time   - The idea of a nine lost in his own world  incapable of leaving   Still  I give it only a 3 out of 10 for certain flaws   - Horrible second part  It seems that the director was very eager to make something new  but despite of the efforts it was really boring  - Very annoying character Melissa  I couldn't stand the scenes with her - i e  it was constantly annoying  She represents everything that is wrong with American woman   - Terrible explanation of the numbers  The director was so busy with character development  that he completely missed the point of a good story   excuse me koalas  brr    terrible  This movie had great potential  The filming is nicely done  the music is really good  but nothing more  See it only if you are a fan of Ryan Reynolds  or have a lot of time to spare
