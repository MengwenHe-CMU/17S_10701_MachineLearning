    Possable spoiler but probably not     The game is called donkey kong but donkey kong is not even in it anymore  Diddy is gone aswell  The 1st Donkey Kong Country was one of my two all time favorite Super Nintendo games   The other being Super Mario World  The 2nd Donkey Kong at least had diddy kong and good levels  although it felt more like a game based on pirates at times  However this one is the worst of the lot  It does not have the feel of the original or 2nd  The enemy's look stupid and the levels are even worse  It does not look realistic anymore  I did not enjoy his game unlike the last two  the first had great background music and the 2nd was not bad but the music in this game is horrible  It happens a lot these days that movies  shows and sometimes video games that start out fantastic  end up with it being ruined by a stupid sequel  I am sad to say I feel that donkey kong as a saga is not as good now that it has Donkey Kong 3  They should have left it at the original or MAYBE the 2nd one
