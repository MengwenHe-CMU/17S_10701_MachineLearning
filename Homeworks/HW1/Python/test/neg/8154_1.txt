The only thing I expected that this film didn't have was an intelligent  talking motorcycle  This film is just plain awful  I gave it 1 star  which of course  means I enjoyed it tremendously  Bad acting  bad writing  bad directing  bad fight choreography  The only real actor in this movie is Martin Landau  who of course does a good job playing the villain  although the character is your standard cardboard cutout evil CEO Villain  Even the so-called  plot twist  at the end was no shock  There was so much to make fun of in this movie  I enjoyed it a lot  And it did have a few impressive car wreck stunts  Like bad movies  Check this one out  ouch  Want a good movie  Not here
