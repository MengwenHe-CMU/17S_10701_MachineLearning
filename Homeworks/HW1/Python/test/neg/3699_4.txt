This is a fair movie  good for one-off viewing  The plot itself is fairly well worked for a picture of this kind which is a pleasent surprise as is the acting  which although a little hammy  is better than normal for these types of flick  The 'special effects' are hilarious - a translucent giant and a blatantly polystyrene papier mache hand wobbling unconvincingly on a bit of wire  Definitely to watch once for kitsch entertainment value  5 10
