I wish I would have read more reviews and more opinions about this movie before I rented it  A waste of money  A waste of time  Very little dialog  The dialog was hard to understand in every way  The storyline and plot were both weak  The only thing that was nice at all was the cinematography  The characters were interesting  At the same time you will spend so much time trying to figure things out  because of the lack of dialog  that you will be rewinding the movie a lot   Do not watch this movie  It was a mess and will leave you feeling like a mess  You will say  what the heck was that  when the movie ends
