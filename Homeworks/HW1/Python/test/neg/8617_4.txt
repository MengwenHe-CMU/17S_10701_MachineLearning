There's a good story well hidden and never really used   The film is short and overly dependent on action and thematic photography  somehow  character and story development have been forgotten  What is left is muddled and superficial  Turn off your brain and watch  you will probably find that the time goes quickly enough  but unless you are the sort of person that finds soaps deep and meaningful  you are going to get no real satisfaction from this film  Watch only if you have nothing better to do and then only if someone else pays for the video rental
