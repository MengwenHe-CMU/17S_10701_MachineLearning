First of all  the genre of this movie isn't comedy  it's more of a drama  I had low expectations on the movie  and still they didn't come up them  As some of the other reviews point out  there are some nice music in the movie  But if you want to listen to good music I suggest spend the time looking at some concert recording with Bon Jovi  or M  tley Crue  it'll be more quality time  Last  if you want to watch a GOOD movie in this rock'n'roll genre  I recommend  Almost Famous
