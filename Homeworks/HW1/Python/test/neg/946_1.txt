Synopsis  Kid is not accepted into any colleges  He creates a  college  where he and his friends can party by using their parent's tuition money   Wow  A Paean to ignorance   If you believe that we're all OK  man  then this movie is for you  Furthermore  you must understand that  1  Kids have it all inside them--they just need to let it out  2  Teaching really stifles the innate creativity that everyone is born with   3  Someone else should pay for you to follow your passion   4  300 teenagers can live together in harmony  as long as you take away those restrictive rules   5  Extemporaneous speeches are often much more convincing than a prepared presentation   6  If the Board of Education allows you to open a  charter school  with  nontraditional teaching techniques   it's because they have your best interests at heart   Not that they are willing to let go of low-functioning students who will end up working fast food anyways    This movie is one in the college comedy genre  i e  Animal House  It follows the pattern pretty closely  What's new here though  is a complete attack on higher education  not a parody of the bad elements  It's missing the sympathetic insider  a professor who embodies the worthwhile part of university life   This lack of balance will doom this film to the back rows of Blockbuster  It is so one sided  that I wondered if it was an ironic self-referential take on the whole genre--for about one minute  The movie has no deep meaning  no layers  no introspection  It's as if they let some kids who never went to class do what comes naturally  And what is natural is what the name of the school is  S       Never thought I'd say this  Go see something with Will Farrell instead  His comedies can be surprisingly sophisticated
