We all know that special effects cost money  but it seems as if they could have used the money they saved writing the script to get some better shots  The train is obviously a model in most moving shots  the helicopter is obviously computer generated  the alien looks like the one from the end of Spaceballs  except it's a decade later and Spaceballs had an excuse  The only smart thing they did was blur all of the special effects to make them harder to see  Not even the actors could compensate for such a poorly written script and it's pretty obvious they didn't really try either  Please  don't waste your time  Please
