The storyline seemed fine  the actors seemed fine  the movie should have been fine  But it sure wasn't - It didn't lead us anywhere  the scenes are weird  Maybe it was meant to create something new  to make us think  That atleast it did  Where is the rest of this film  To me it was waste of money  time  and talent  Someone might want to see this for curiosity  to see if they can figure it out  Other I personally wouldn't recommend this to anyone
