Thinking that it could only get better was the worst assumption I ever made     Drivvle does not describe this movie appropriately enough  Not only is the plot thin  but I get more emotional acting from my pet fish  It was a shame to see Pete Postlethwaite  whom I respect as an actor trying to do the best with the little he had to work with    I think that a cardboard cut out of Stephen Baldwin would have done a better job   and in fact have been more animate  Avoid at all costs  This could really be hazardous to your health
