Controversial German journalist Jutta Rabe who herself got divers to the Estonia wreck  put this silly  thriller  together to save her investment  Donald Sutherland is of course always watchable - but he's only in three scenes  He delivers his material perfectly - as you can ask from a professional  Also  the main lead  J  rgen Prochnov  is at times very good  The rest of the cast is  however  bad  The actress that plays the Swedish minister secretary  or whatever she was - she seems not listed in the cast  is EXTREMELY bad  The script has some nice ideas  and the story is actually kind of interesting  The final screenplay should have been re-written a couple of more times though  Some scenes are plain ridiculous - especially the end scenes  The film is almost 2 hours  which is about 45 minutes too long  Presented as a 60 minutes TV-film  this could have been really interesting  As a two hour feature  it's pretentious  boring  stupid and plain out silly  Jutta Rabe might be a good journalist  her ideas about governments using Estonia to transport military items from Estonia to Sweden have been concluded as true recently  when the Swedish military officially said that they actually used the ship Estonia for this   but as a film producer she sucks  The director  the writer and the actors suck more  I give this film 3 10  I would've given it a 1  if it wasn't for the fact that the story is quite interesting at times  Donald Sutherland is in it and it has real stock footage  But we don't even see the boat sink  What kind of movie about a ship that sinks is that  Like a werewolf movie without werewolves
