 If you like rap or hip-hop  watch this movie  although it's funny if you don't get the references  as a straight comedy  Haven't seen much of the much hyped CB4  but what I did see didn't have the heart that this little stormer has  Haven't heard from the people involved since  which is a surprise  The film is very similar to Spinal Tap  which is no bad thing  and I think a lot of the dialogue  while priceless in Tap is funnier here  probably because I'm more into rap than rock theses days  so my own judgment does cloud that point  The rap songs are funny as hell  and it's basically spot the reference for most of the film  not all of them are in-your-face  which means the physical comedy and the one-liners get priority over the take-offs  Great fun  one to watch twice if there ever was a movie
