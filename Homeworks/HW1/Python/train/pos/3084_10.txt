Oh man  why   Six Degrees  is a show about this so called theory that we all are linked by someone  If focus on the lives of a group of people and the consequences of their actions  When I first heard of this show  it didn't caught my attention at all  It seemed too ordinary  actually  Then  i saw some episodes    and loved it  First of all  the characters  They are all well-written and different from each other  There's a alcohol addicted  a woman whose fianc  e cheats on her  a woman who just lost her husband  a driver who has a troubled brother and so on    Unlike what we're used to  most of the characters interact with each other in casualties  like in our daily routines  Great  My favourite ones are Mae  Carlos and Whitney  Then  the cast  They are all great  Jay Hernandez  from  Hostel   shows here his acting habilities in a more 3d character than his previous work as Paxton  The other ones give great performances too  specially Campbell Scott  who plays Steven and Bridget Moynahan  who plays Whitney  Well when i came to IMDb  after watching some episodes  i couldn't believe that it got cancelled  Seriously  i can't understand the low ratings  It's too bad it didn't have more than one season  It would really be a good show to follow
