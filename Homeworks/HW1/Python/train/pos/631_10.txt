This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have  romance  clever witticisms  great acting and a fair dose of magic   I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot  based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read  and colorful characters  One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is  Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale  satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel  Original  Fun  Feel-good Fantasy
