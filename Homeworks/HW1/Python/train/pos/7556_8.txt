Okay  that was a pretty damn good episode  Much better than the credit it receives  The camera work is splendid  Best yet  I love that final shot  The atmosphere is fantastic  the costumes are great and the guest cast  minus the helpless victims  is strong   What I don't like about this episode is that many things that are left unexplained  why does it change sex  what's the purpose  and they're aliens  what kind  why were they never shown again in the later mythology  I'm giving this episode a high THREE stars  One of my favorites yet  but the plot holes bother me  Still    not gonna let it ruin my entertainment
