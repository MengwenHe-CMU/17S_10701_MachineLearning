Return To the Lost World was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 version of The Lost World  In this sequel  the same five people  lead by Challenger return to the plateau where a group has started drilling for oil which is threatening to destroy the land  Gomez has something to do with this  They manage to defeat the drillers and the plateau is saved  much to the delight of the natives  Like in The Lost World  what few dinosaurs we see are made of rubber and these include a T-Rex and Ankylosaurus  John Ryhs-Davies and David Warner reprise their roles as Challenger and Summerlee and three of the other actors are also back  Despite reading several bad reviews of this and those cheap looking rubber dinosaurs  I enjoyed Return to the Lost World  Rating  3 stars out of 5
