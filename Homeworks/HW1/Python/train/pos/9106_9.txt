Since I watched it for the first time   Piedras  is a personal favorite and one of the few pictures I actually could watch over and over again  The great screenplay depicts the lives of a bunch of women  all of them somehow interconnected  with deep understanding and sensibility  Ram  n Salazar achieved a compelling film in his directorial debut  and proves himself as an efficient actors' director   Not that all performances are excellent  though  Of all leading ladies  they range from average  Najwa Nimri  to very good  Vicky Pe  a   but the standing ovation should be directed to newcomer M  nica Cervera  who convincingly plays Antonia San Juan's retarded daughter  Enrique Alcides is irresistibly charming as the girl's male nurse  and there are nice small turns from Andr  s Gertr  dix  Geli Albaladejo and the director himself  Ram  n Salazar   Piedras  is beautifully written and filmed  when I watched it I got so moved that I couldn't stop thinking of it for days  I highly recommend it
