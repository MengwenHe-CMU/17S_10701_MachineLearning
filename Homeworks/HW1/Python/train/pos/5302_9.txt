This movie kept me constantly entertained  In comparing this to Serial Mom  Mr  Waters has gone back to his grittier side  This is not nearly as polished  There is a dark side here  A message about how success and fame changes a person -- but more importantly how it changes the people around you  There is not a false moment in this film  The characters are somewhat cartoonish    but I want to believe that is what Mr  Waters is trying to achieve  It is fascinating to watch how Mr  Waters has evolved    This is truly his finest work
