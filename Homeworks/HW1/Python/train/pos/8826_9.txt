If you're amused by straight-faced goings-on that are logical within a given illogical situation  you'll enjoy this whimsical 8-minute Spanish film  A woman enters a small caf    The scene looks ordinary  but the counterman  customers  and two musicians seem somehow oddly subdued  Suddenly  the musicians play and one man begins to sing the title song   dancing across table tops with musical-comedy gestures  The customers  at first immobile  at intervals chime in  badly but gamely  with phrases from the song  read from slips of paper in their palms  On and off they jump up and dance  awkwardly but earnestly  in choreographed motions  like backup singers  But why    the woman wonders  The answer is revealed as the soloist's jacket opens and she sees what's strapped across his chest -- just before the explosive climax    Even if you don't catch the song's  probably ironical  lyrics  the situation-perfect performances should give you a grin and a chuckle    I'd love to see it again
