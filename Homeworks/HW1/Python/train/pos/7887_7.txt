If your a hard core Freddy fan then you might not like it  This seems to be a spoof of the nightmare series  Not much to see here  The only reason it holds it self up is the back story on Freddy  The one thing that is always great in Nightmare movies are the death scenes  But the death scenes were very crappy in this  The visual effects were great and the acting was OK but the back story was excellent  Basically Freddy's story comes full circle in this  I have read bad reviews for this but i actually enjoyed this despite its many flaws   1  A Nightmare on Elm Street   8 10   2  Freddy's Dead  The Final Nightmare   7 10   3  A Nightmare on Elm Street 4  The Dream Master   7 10   4  A Nightmare on Elm Street 3  The Dream Warriors   7 10   5  A Nightmare on Elm Street 5  The Dream Child   6 10   6  A Nightmare on Elm Street 2  Freddy's Revenge   3 10   I recommend it if you enjoy the series  This is were Freddy is fully explained but thats all there is  Next on my list Wes Cravens New Nightmare   7 10
