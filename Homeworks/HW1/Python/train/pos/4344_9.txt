The movie gets to the guts of the tension between a son and a father  The brilliant dialog  lovely scenery and great acting serve as an excellent way to present the onion that keeps peeling back layers  The core issues of parenting  communication and manhood are explored indirectly  In fun ways the curtain is pulled back  the masks slip off a little and truths are exposed  All of this happens amidst a road trip format  The backdrop is rural New York state in the early fall just as the trees are changing colors  WOW
