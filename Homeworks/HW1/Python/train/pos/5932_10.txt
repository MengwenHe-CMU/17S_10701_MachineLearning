Best Stephen King film alongside IT  though this one is more fun than scary   This one's got it all   -a great cast with a Alice Krige and Brian Krause and a fun cameo from King himself  -well dosed horror in an amusing storyline  -great use of music  Santo   Johnny's  Sleepwalk  in particular  -likeable characters in a typical King setting  middle of nowhere village  -lots of humor  You can't really get good scares here because it's too much fun and over the top  -old but really nice makeup effects like they don't make anymore  A 4 5 rating  I don't get it really  When was the last time a horror film was as much fun as this one
