There are few films or movies I consider favorites over the years  The Gospel road was one of them  I watched this as a young teen and would like the opportunity to watch it again  My favorite parts were the fact that  1 Jesus was blond   2 the last supper was a huge meal  3  he liked playing with the children  4 His death was for all people and for all time  The movie may not have been theologically sound or high quality acting  but it touched my heart at that time  Besides I am a Johnny Cash fan and it was a brave venture  If it ever comes out on DVD  I will purchase it purely for sentimental reasons
