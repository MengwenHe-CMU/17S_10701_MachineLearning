I think a great many viewers missed entirely the fact that this is obviously a parody of western films  This is not a bad movie - it is a clever tongue in cheek take on westerns  I don't believe this film was taking itself seriously for a moment  What makes this film even more unique is the fact it is centered around 4 strong  beautiful women  two of which are black  one Asian  and a Mexican Hispanic character  These aren't your usual western women--they're tough--they can draw fast and shoot straight  They're so tough even the bartender is shaking when he pours their whiskey  The plot which moves this story along is typical of westerns--in the vein of  you shot my brother--so I'm gonna get you   Only in this western  a woman's sister has been shot and she's out for vengeance on the gang who did it  So she goes and rounds up her old cronies from her bank robbing days  One of them  Maria  is not really all that interested in avenging Rachel's sister  but she is motived by the fact there's gold and jewelry hidden in the town where they're headed  There are a couple of scenes that don't quite make sense  not that they interfere that much  they can be ignored  but I wondered why they were there  So the film could use a little tightening  but over all  this is a well made film that has failed to find an audience that recognized what it is  My only disappointment was that the only lesbian in the film is a villain--of the  heroines   one is obviously straight  the others sexual orientations are never disclosed  7 Stars
