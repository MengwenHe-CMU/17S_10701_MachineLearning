As a Pok  mon fan I enjoyed this movie very much  It introduces new legendary Pok  mon  as each movie does  and adds depth to the relationships between its characters  I however do not expect those who are not Pok  mon fans to enjoy it This includes MOST adults   Some of the lines were corny  but that can be somewhat unavoidable when dubbing the movie over to English  The animation was beautiful  although there were a couple parts that did not look good  And although the villain is kind of corny  I think that the movies have done a good job of cycling through different types of villains  and I guarantee you that they aren't all like this one  Those who did not like it  I say to each his own  but Pok  mon fans will love it
