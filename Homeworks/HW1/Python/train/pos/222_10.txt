A hilarious Neil Simon comedy that evokes laughs from beginning to end  The late Walter Matthau is the grouchy ex-comedian who is persuaded to join together with his ex-partner  the late Oscar-winner George Burns  for a final reunion show on stage  Benjamin Martin is Matthau's agent and nephew  and the two have just as much chemistry as Matthau and Burns  I love Matthau's grumpy character--he's just the same as he always is  and yet also very different  Burns  as the absent-minded old man  is just as funny as Matthau  Matthau  Want some crackers  I've got coconut  pineapple and graham  Burns  How about a plain cracker  Matthau  I don't got plain  I got coconut  pineapple and graham  Burns  Okay Matthau  They're in the cupboard in the kitchen  Burns  Maybe later  Or how about this  Matthau  When I did black  the whites knew what I was saying  You've got to see it in the movie to understand it  All in all  a refreshingly hilarious  sweet  heartfelt  warm  belivable character comedy with a heart and some of the most memorable quotes of all time   They just don't make them like this anymore  In a time when all the newest comedies are crude  juvenile and stupid  this leans back towards the tender core of what comedy really is--funny characters  smart and funny dialogue  and grand entertainment  One of the best buddy comedies of all time  right up there with  Planes  Trains and Automobiles    Lethal Weapon   and  The Hard Way   You may have a hard time finding this for rent or on TV  but trust me  it will be worth your time  4 5 5 stars  - John Ulmer
