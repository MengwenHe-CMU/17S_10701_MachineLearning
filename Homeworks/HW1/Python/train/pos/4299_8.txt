At your video store  you might find this gem  The human condition in modern times LA  No exaggerated drama  just a collapsing of events that might happen to any group of individuals over time  Helps you understand the joys and desperation of urban life  The direction and cutting are top class  Cinematography and music very much follows the mood and situation  And the CAST     Excellent casting and excellent acting  No one out of place or out of character  And it's NOT really as much a downer as you would expect  I gave it 7 of 10  If you havent seen it  DO
