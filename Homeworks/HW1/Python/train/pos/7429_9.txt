She is such an extraordinary singer  who cares about anything else     That final scene is one of the best moments in all of show biz - bar none   I'm glad she kept the camera on herself for ten minutes - she deserves that iconic status - such is the power of the voice   I first saw this film when I was five and it had a huge impact on me  I see it today  and yes  I can see some of the flaws  like Esther wanting to leave the Grammy's right as her award is being announced   But some of the other user comments are just plain false - I mean  where is the gratuitous nudity - maybe we saw different films     Streisand's singing ability is monumental  and if she has a big ego - fine   She's earned it
