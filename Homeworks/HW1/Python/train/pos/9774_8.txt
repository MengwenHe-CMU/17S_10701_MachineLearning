This movie has its ups and downs  but to me the good stuff in this movie very much outweighs the bads    What's not so good about the movie are indeed sometimes the dialogue  the sounds  the lighting am I the only one who noticed the way the sets were lighted was amateur  and the acting     What is very good are the highly original storyline  the very intense atmosphere  the gore factor which is very high  and the effects which are done supremely  So  definitely worth watching  or maybe even a must-see for all you horror and gore fans
