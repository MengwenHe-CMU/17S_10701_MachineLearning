The first time I saw this film  I loved it  It was different  I am a Christian  Bible believing   I don't go along with the crowd of right wing believers  I dropped out of that atmosphere  To me in their attempts to take over our government they are doing what Judas tried to do  I call it the Judas Syndrome  Judas didn't get it  even though Jesus said his Kingdom was not of this world  This film certainly showed some of that  I also liked that Jesus enjoyed the simple pleasure of playing games and jokes with his disciples  Also he was a very gorgeous Jesus  It's a watch-over and over movie  Very satisfying
