Marvelous James Stewart  Vera Miles vehicle  What makes this historical film dealing with the FBI so good is the family element that is involved during a 35 year career as depicted by Stewart in the film  The film shows a history of the great investigatory agency  It deals with airplane bomb plots  killing off of Indians in Oklahoma for real estate gain  fighting organized crime  Nazis and Communists in that order  The human element is never far behind as Stewart weds Vera Miles  They raise 3 children as Miles' heart goes out each time Stewart goes out on assignment  Look for a brief but memorable performance by Murray Hamilton  Years later  he appeared as Mr  Robinson in 1967's  The Graduate   The film has nothing but praise for J  Edgar Hoover  He certainly brought the FBI up to par  True  this could be viewed as right-wing propaganda  especially with Stewart's real-life Republican views  but it's well done  historically informative  and the view of the family so well depicted
