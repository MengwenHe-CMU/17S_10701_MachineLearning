 Nothin'  There ain't nothing' in Room 237  But you ain't got no business going' in there anyway  So stay out  You understand  Stay out    Never has there been such a feat of psychological horror as this film achieves  This is the highest rated horror film of all and rightly so  Jack nicholson is a superb actor and this is one of the greatest performances in cinema  Its about a family moving to an isolated and deserted hotel for 5 months over the winter  Then the father  Jack  becomes almost possessed by the horrors in the hotel  Kubricks direction is nothing short then perfect  The tense tracking shots  agonising music  mystical messages and perplexing plot makes this the best horror film ever made  Throughout the film there is constant references to danger  death and horror  Red is used in EVERY scene  Is the red purposely put in by Kubrick  Of course   This is a definitive Kubrick classic and this is the third of his films I have given 10 10  He is a perfectionist in his direction and you can see it in all his films  He loves to perplex his watchers in everyone of his films  I will be talking about this film for months to come  It has infinite depth  In conclusion  this is the cornerstone of horror and tension  A masterpiece of terror 10 10
