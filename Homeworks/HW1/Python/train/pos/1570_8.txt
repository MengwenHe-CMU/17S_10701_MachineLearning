OK  here is my personal list of top Nicktoons shows as in today  1  All Grown Up SpongeBob SquarePants 2  My Life as a Teenage Robot 3  Invader Zim 4  CATSCRATCH Rugrats Notice a word with only capital letters  That means this is the Nick show I'm going to talk about   Catscratch  is basically a simple but great animated comedy about three wealthy cats - Mr  Blik  Gordon  and Waffles - who get into weird and REALLY surreal situations  from attempting to join Human Kimberely's slumber party for root beer to saving a planet of slugs from the evil spaceship  This is one Nick show that you will simply have your funny bone tickled sooner or later  The theme song is catchy and memorable  Voice actors - including Wayne Knight from the  Seinfield  franchise - brings the characters to fresh life with very quirky personalities  The stories are enjoyable  fans' episodes would be  King of All Root Beer  and  Gordon's Lucky Claw    And the humor is all done in some style of Earthworm Jim   So in conclusion   Catscratch  is one of the Nicktoons series  like  Invader Zim  and  MLAATR   which becomes very  very popular all over the world in just 3 seasons or less
