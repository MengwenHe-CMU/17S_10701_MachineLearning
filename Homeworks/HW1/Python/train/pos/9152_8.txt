This is a good film for 99  of the duration  I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaim  It is shot in a rather naive fashion  This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film - a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming technique  The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the 'nutcase' called Joe  However  the wholesome  normal  characters are a little too pathetic for my liking - granted  they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTT  The film starts slowly  and the naive camera work smacks of 'B' movie to start with  and very normally but you soon get a feel of the impending brutality that is about to occur  This is one of the most 'twisted' movies with respect to cold-hearted violence  After the abrupt and unbelievably lazy ending I was left feeling disappointed  I would have given the film a 9 if the ending was in keeping with the rest of the film but as it is it gets only a 7 on the strength of the 'eeriness' and nail-biting scenes earlier on in the film  Give it a watch and excuse the ending
