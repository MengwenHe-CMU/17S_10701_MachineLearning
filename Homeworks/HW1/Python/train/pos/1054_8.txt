If you want mindless action  hot chicks and a post-apocalyptic view of Seattle  then this is the show for you  The concept of Dark Angel isn't anything new  in fact  there's controversy over whether James Cameron stole the idea from a book   but I spend the entire hour watching it every Tuesday from start to finish  Jessica Alba is smoking and Max' friends  original Cindy  Kendra  are just as hot   The fight scenes are getting better  but the dialogues between Original Cindy and Max need to be a little bit better  the slang sounds forced and it sounds like someone living in the suburbs wrote it   In my opinion  Dark Angel is a great guilty pleasure filled with everything an action fan could ask for  but if you're looking for hard hitting  award-winning drama  go watch  The West Wing  or something
