Not a film to be taken seriously  but a great little film nonetheless  It's definitely NOT just a piece of fluff  The acting  IMO  is excellent  One of those films you wouldn't go out of your way to see  but it brings a smile every time it comes around on cable  Like an old friend  Definitely worth seeing if you get the chance  - - - - - - - -
