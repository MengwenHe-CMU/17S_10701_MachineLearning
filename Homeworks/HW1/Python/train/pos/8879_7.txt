    SPOILERS      this movie always seems very exaggerated  until i remember that my college campus had a former-student-turned-Nazi-racist-killer-who-then-committed-suicide  too  his name was Benjamin Nathaniel Smith  look him up in the wikipedia- i added a few photos to their article about him  it's hard to believe  but this stuff really does happen  i'm not a big fan of Omar Epps or Ice Cube  but Larry Fishburne  Kristy Swanson  Jennifer Connelly   Mike Rappaport were good
