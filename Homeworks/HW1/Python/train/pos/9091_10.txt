A fabulous film  With everything you could want in a film  Huge battle scenes and lots of other action  Suspense  and a romantic love story   Kind of like an old swashbuckler film  Totally entertaining from start to finish   The editing was fast and you are never bored for a second  The story is like a classic story of trouble in the Royal Household  The actors are beautiful and the sets magnificent  The costumes are spectacular and the stunt work is imaginative  The special effects are amazing too  Gary Stretch is really impressive as an actor and gorgeous to look at  He looks like a sure bet for Super Stardom   John Rhys-Davies is wonderful as he usually is  He is one of the great actors of our time  And Cindy Burbridge  Ex Miss Thailand is excellent and perfect for the leading lady  even doing an English accent with remarkable success   I found out that the film has won numerous awards  and i can see why  All in all this is an amazing Independent film  See it for sure   I highly recommend it  And give it a TEN
