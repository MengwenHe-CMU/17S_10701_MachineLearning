Hmmm  yeah this episode is extremely underrated  Even though there is a LOT of bad writing and acting at parts  I think the good over wins the bad   I love the origami parts and the big 'twist' at the end  I absolutely love that scene when Michelle confronts Tony  It's actually one of my favorite scenes of Season 1   For some reason  people have always hated the Reincarnation episodes  yet I have always liked them  They're not the best  in terms of writing  but the theme really does interest me  I'm gonna give it a THREE star  but if the writing were a little more consistent i'd give it FOUR
