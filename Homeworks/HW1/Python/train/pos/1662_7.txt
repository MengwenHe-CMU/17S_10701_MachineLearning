The film of Artemisia may be considered treason  or as true artistic license   Which might one aver  In documented history  Artemisia Gentileschi was subjected to the thumbscrew  and still affirmed that she was r   ed  as Mary Garrard and Gloria Steinem have eloquently affirmed  In the movie  under a different torture  she refused to condemn her lover violator  How may a movie deviate so much from received history  yet still inform the human heart  The answer is not so hard to find  In the movie  the director and cast had filled a gaping hole in the historical record  with the power of imagination  That led to a conclusion that differs from the record  So be it  I find _both_ the record and the movie to be compelling  In both the movie and  it seems  in history  Artemisia was a painter  before all else  For that vision  framed in ravishing  sic  film composition  I am truly grateful  Seldom have I seen a movie that so compelled my eyes  David Broadhurst
