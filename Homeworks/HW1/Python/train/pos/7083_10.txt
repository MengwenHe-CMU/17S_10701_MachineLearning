A great addition to anyone's collection  12 monkeys is a movie you don't see every day  It has excellent actors to go with a excellent story  This is not a normal role for Bruce Willis but he holds the role like he holds John McClane  The virus-kills everyone on earth and leaves a few hundred survivors story is not a new one but the story takes a fresh new direction on it  A man Bruce is sent back in time to get information on a virus which has wiped out most of man kind  The actors in this were awesome  I must give a mention to Brad Pitt who was hilarious as the mental patient James Cole Bruce  meets in a mental hospital  The director did an amazing job on bringing us a disturbing picture of a future devastated by a man-made virus  The animals seen in the virus world made it feel like they run the world when humans are driven into underground facilities  This movie was excellent and must see and also its a must own  I very much highly recommend it  10 10
