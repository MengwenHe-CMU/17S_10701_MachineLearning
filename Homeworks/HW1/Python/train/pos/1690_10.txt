I found the memorable quotes searching for video clips  they forgot one of my favorites    Old Person 1  You know  I remember the first time they played that thing   Old Person 2  You remember pterodactyls   Old Person 1  And I can remember you fell for that  hook line and sinker   Old Person 2  Oh  I did not   Old Lady  You did so  You put a big bucket on your head and took off with them army boys to fight Martians   Old Person 2  Ain't you dead yet
