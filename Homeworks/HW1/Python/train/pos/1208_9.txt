Every kid has that movie that he pops into VHS when he has nothing to do  or when there is a babysitter around  This was that movie for me   I can tell you the whole plot exactly  I must have seen it 100 times at least  and I can say it is a good kids family movie  I still have the tape  I haven't watched it in 5 years  but maybe I'll get around to it this week  and be a kid for the day   You just have to love the care bears  and their messege
