A sober  reflexive piece  a little miniature which blossoms into a magnificent humane pictorial sequence which goes beyond a mere dramatization for the screen  This quiet little story will hold you enthralled - if you do not have too many problems with the various Spanish accents ranging from Mexican to Peruvian  and Marisa Paredes' more authentic Iberian Peninsular usage  Garc  adiego has accomplished a perfect adaptation from the novel  even the grand maestro Garc  a M  rquez should be proud of her superb work  And hats off to Arturo Ripstein who has so ably concerted the whole effort into a gem  a ruby  and so refined  so elegant  so sensitive  so touchingly      El Coronel - Fernando Luj  n - is waiting to get his pension  while he continues to live in his ramshackle timber dwelling deep in the Colombian jungle  however  filmed elsewhere  NOT in Colombia  with his fighting cock and his wife  in that order    And that is all there is to it  But  oh  so much more     This film is a rhapsody  I must see this poetic little piece again as soon as possible  Worth the high side of 8 out of 10  which is very high on my scale  This is not light commercial Hollywood stuff
