Though not seen in too many films prior  you have certainly seen the basic plot themes in too many films since   Not one of Grant's nor Loy's best films  they make an outstanding effort together  After all  with that much talent and very good supporting cast  you know the laughs will be there  The film is light  has some dramatic spotting but keeps the plot moving and gets you to smile the whole way through  A great example of classic American film fare that has stood the test of time  Definite Saturday afternoon fare  heavy on the popcorn
