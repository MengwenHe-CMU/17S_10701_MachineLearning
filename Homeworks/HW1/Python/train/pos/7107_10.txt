You can call it a mystery  perhaps a small thriller  or an intelligent film  The story takes you through the life of one person who has lost his life and is looking to regain it  I have to say I was quite surprised that I truly did enjoy this film  It is not usually the genre I care for however the characters quickly became people to me and I wanted to know what they were about and what was going to happen to them  Just like many french films over English made  we are able to learn much more about the character and the affect of their surroundings on their person  This film is character driven and will not disappoint
