This is not a bad film  It is not wildly funny  but it is interesting and entertaining  It has a few funny moments  Cher gives a good performance in a role that is very opposite her real-life self  Her performance alone is worth the watch  If this movie had come out today it would not have been nominated  but by '80s standards it was excellent
