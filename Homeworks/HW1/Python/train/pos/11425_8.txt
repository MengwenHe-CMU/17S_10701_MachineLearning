The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa  but it is so much more than that  Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things  A longing for another  one of a different race  that cannot be consummated  Even a glance is forbidden  There are no words needed  Their facial expressions say everything  It is the story of a black servant  Prot  e  Isaach De Bankol    and a white woman  Aim  e  Giulia Boschi   Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other  The little girl  France  C  cile Ducasse  is lonely and spends all her time with Prot  e  She really can't see this dance  One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials  They cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves  There world is about to end  they just don't know it yet  Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence  I think I would like to visit this Africa  It seems so quiet  especially at night when you only hear the animals
