I'm surprised how many people give this move less than 7 stars  But they just don't understand the movie  The story is about growing up in a difficult situation  There is a crazy grandmother who really wants the best for your grandchildren  And there's good reason why so many critics like this movie  And the reason is because they understand the movie  I feel sorry for the low scores given by some people  I wish I could just write a brief summary of a movie but IMDb requires you to write 10 lines  I frankly don't have anything else to say
