There is no denying that Ealing comedies are good  but for me this film stands out as one of the best  The basic premise of the film is that a small part of Pimlico in London is discovered to be part of Burgundy  not the UK  We then follow the lives of the residents in their battle to keep the treasure found after the bomb explodes  and keep out the black market traders who soon realise that being exempt from UK law  rationing does not exist  When they become prisoners in their own street because the government has decided to close the boarder we see them fight back against the system  They are forced to ration water and food in their stand for what is right  In fact becoming worse off than they were before it all started  that's where the moral comes in  It's when they loose all the food that they think they are beaten and call for a surrender  only to have the whole of London respond to their plight by sending food  lot's of it  Thus enabling them to continue their struggle  This film hit's the right note throughout  the acting is superb  with Stanley Holloway  Margaret Rutherford  Hermione Baddeley and Betty Warren standing out  It's pitched just right  not too sentimental and the moral of the story not forced down your throat  Well worth a viewing
