I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why not  Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time  I mean I just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant  The story is new and different  The movie also has two great leads in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner  The acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie  The music is just excellent  it give you chills and can also make you feel relax  I just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring  Red Eye is just phenomenal  Nothing more and nothing less  It's a excellent thriller  Overall  I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can watch it over and over again  If you like Red Eye  then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf  I give Red Eye 9 out of 10  Great movie
