This is absolutely one of the best movies I've ever seen  It takes me on a a roller-coaster of emotions  I laugh and cry and get disgusted and happy and in love  All this in a little over two hours of time   The actors are all brilliant  I have to mention the leading actor of course  Michael Nyquist  He does a remarkable job   I also admire the actor who plays Tore  who plays this mentally-challenged young man in such a convincing way  He sort of reminded me of Leonardo di Caprios roll in Gilbert Grape  And then there is the most beautiful song in the world  Gabriella's s  ng  I recommend this for everyone to see and enjoy
