The best Treasure Island ever made  They just don't make films like this anymore  or ever  No one makes films like this  More than a novelty  this film is funny  frank and fascinating  yet moody  mysterious and morose  This is one of my favorite pictures  The director must have had some idea what it is all about  but he certainly leaves room for your own impressions and interpretations  while leaving little left to the imagination  Why he has not made more films like this  I have no idea  While reminding me of some of the best noir  it is one of a kind  But this is not for the lazy or simple
