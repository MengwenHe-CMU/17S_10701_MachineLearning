I stumbled on this late last night n TCM  Hadn't seen it since it came out originally  but had never forgotten it  I had completely forgotten how gorgeous and talented Signe Hasso was when she was still young  ditto for Shelly Winters before she balooned out  Ronald Coleman  though  was the quintessential state actor of his time - I had read Othello in high school English - and HATED it  After seeing  A Double Life  I read it again and finally understood what the play was about  The Gordon Kanin writing team was at its peak when this script was done - A movie well worth remembering and rewatching
