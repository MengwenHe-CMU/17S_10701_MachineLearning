My very favorite character in films  but in nearly all of them the character of Zorro has a small bit of cloth as a mask and if the villain s can t tell who is under that cloth then they are daft  But in Reed Hadley s  Zorro s Fighting Legion   serial 1939  the mask fills his whole face making it a real mystery as to who Zorro really is  But anyway Zorro is one of the best character s in films and to bring it up to date l think Anthony Hopkins in  The Mask of Zorro   1998  is a delight  My interest in films is vast  but l have a real liking for the serial s of the 30s 40s     Bond2a
