Magnificent and unforgettable  stunningly atmospheric  and brilliantly acted by all  I really cannot understand what sort of people are panning this masterpiece and giving the preponderance of votes as 8  and nine ones   This  along with Grapes of Wrath  is John Ford's greatest movie  I would say that Long Voyage Home is next in line  though quite a way back  Rating  10  It deserves a 12
