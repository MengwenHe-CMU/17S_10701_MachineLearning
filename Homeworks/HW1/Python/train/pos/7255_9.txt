This is not a movie you watch for entertainment  at least most people I know would not  It's portraits the cruelty to both body and mind that happen in a war pretty well  the characters seem plausible  especially because you  read their minds   something more often found in books and rarely in movies  however done very well in this piece  I would place it next to  All quiet on the western front  and  Die Br  cke  in terms of leaving a lasting impression  I wish I could screen it at school  along with the other two movies - however finding a copy of it showed to be pretty hard - which is a shame
