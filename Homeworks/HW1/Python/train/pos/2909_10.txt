I love Paul McCartney  He is  in my oppinion  the greatest of all time  I could not  however  afford a ticket to his concert at the Tacoma Dome during the Back in the U S  tour  I was upset to say the least  Then I found this DVD  It was almost as good as being there  Paul is still the man and I will enjoy this for years to come   I do have one complaint  I would of like to hear all of Hey Jude  Also Paul is not dead  The single greatest concert DVD ever        out of
