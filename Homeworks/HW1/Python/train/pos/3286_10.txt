Put quite simply  this film is terrifying  It starts off simply  looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film  Don't expect gore  or zombies  This is psychological  and just as he would also do in Candyman  Bernard Rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed  Each time you watch this film  you realise more about what's happening  and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect  Drawings have never been scarier
