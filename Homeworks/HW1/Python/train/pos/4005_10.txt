Although at one point I thought this was going to turn into The Graduate  I have to say that The Mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman  I'm so glad this is a British film because Hollywood never would have done it  and even if they had  they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters  The story is revealed slowly and realistically  The acting is superb  the characters are believably flawed  and the dialogue is sensitive  I tried many times to predict what was going to happen  and I was always wrong  so I was very intrigued by the story  I highly recommend this movie  And I must confess  I'll forever look at my mom in a different light
