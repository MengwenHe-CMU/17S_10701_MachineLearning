Brilliant adaptation of the largely interior monologues of Leopold Bloom  Stephen Dedalus  and Molly Bloom by Joseph Strick in recreating the endearing portrait of Dublin on June 16  1904 - Bloomsday - a day to be celebrated - double entendre intended  Bravo director Strick  screenwriter Haines  as well as casting director and cinematographer in creating this masterpiece  Gunter Grass' novel  The Tin Drum filmed by Volker Schl  ndorff  1979 is another fine film adaptation of interior monologue which I favorably compare with Strick's film  While there are clearly recognized Dublin landmarks in the original novel and in the film  there are also recognizable characters  although with different names in the novel  For example  Buck Mulligan with whom Dedalus lives turns out to be a then prominent Dublin surgeon   This film for all of its excellence is made even richer by additional viewings   Brian invinoveritas1 AOL com 15 June 2008
