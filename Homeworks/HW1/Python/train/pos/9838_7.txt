Born Again is a okay episode of Season 1  The reincarnation bit  in my opinion  is cool  The more I watch it  the more I like it  yet it will never rise above 'Very Good' for me  Even though it is not very memorable  i'll always remember it as the reincarnation episode  Anyway  now I will say what is good and bad about this episode  The Good  Oragami  Oh Yeah  That Fish tank was nice     Thrown out of a window  Very classy  x  The Bad  Marry your Best Friend's wife   O_O What a random pick to reincarnate  Why didn't the guy who died by having his scarf tangled up  try to take his scarf off instead  Conclusion  Okay episode  not very memorable  7 10
