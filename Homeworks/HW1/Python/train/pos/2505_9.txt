Many people judge it as a fan service film because a lot of super star starring in this movie  Gackt  Hyde  and Wang Lee Hom is very famous singer in Japan   But don't judge it before you watch  is what I say  Gackt and staff are very serious when made this film  and they worked so hard  It's a good film with a touchy story inside  Several scenes can be so fun and some others are so sad  They made it so good until I can't stop watching this all over again   The story has written pretty well but I admit that their act are little disappointing  This is especially for Hyde because his skill of acting is under from the other and it is weird to hear the way when he speaks with other language except his native language  Japan   But  it's comprehensibility because this is their first time to act in the movie  I think Gackt trying to show us about how someone can be so weak when they lose the most important person in their life  When Toshi was killed  when Sho asked Kei to turn Yi-Che to being vampire like him because he won't let her die  When Sho's Brother died  Kei Shoot Son die  and the best and beautiful scene is When Sho pass away  even I told that Hyde's skill is still weird but I give him two thumps up at that scene   There's a time where The plot goes too fast like they didn't tell the reason Why Son can join the local mafia and being Sho's enemy because they are a good friend at the past and also Son is Sho's brother in law  Whatever  I love this movie   very much       This is an action movie with a touching beautiful story
