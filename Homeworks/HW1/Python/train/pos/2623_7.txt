I actually like the original  and this film has its ups and downs  Here's just a few  Ups  Most of the original voice cast returned  Downs  I didn't like the voice of Timon's Ma  I know she did a voice in The Simpsons  but that show is just plain stupid   Ups  We get to see Simba as a  teenager   Downs  They wasted it with a slug-slurping contest between Timon and Simba   Ups  It was Rafiki who told Timon about  Hakuna Matata   Downs  How did Pumbaa find out about it  Ups  Songs again   some of the original songs were there  but they were just background music   Downs  But stupid songs   a k a  Timon's solo   Overall  this is a pretty good movie  I'd recommend it for fans of the original  But if you don't like the original  chances are you won't like this one  My Score  7 10
