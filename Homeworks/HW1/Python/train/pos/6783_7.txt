If you like  Othello   you'll love this flick since half the movie revolves around the stage production of the play  The film has a great cast with Signe Hasso and Shelley Winters as the women in Colman's life while Edmond O'Brien plays the enterprising press agent  A couple of the supporting players I particularly liked were Millard Mitchell as the grizzled reporter who finds an angle and Joe Sawyer  the 1940's answer to Drew Carey  who plays the cop on the case  Great raw moments in this one with noir realism throughout
