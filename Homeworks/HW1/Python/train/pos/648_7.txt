I decided to watch this because of the recommendations from this site  I would have to say it was worth the effort  However  you should take heed that this film will go on for 210 minutes  If you don't have the staying power  get it on tape and watch it over a couple of nights  Now to the film  what I say will contain  spoilers  and if you don't mind  here goes   Alexandre is a promiscuous bum  a womanizer and a gigolo  He lives with an older woman called Marie  Marie owns a retail shop and she provides for Alex  Alex spends his days at caf  s and restaurants  The story reveals that Alex had previously impregnated Gilberte whom he used to live with  Gilberte dumped him for a less attractive man that she did not love because Alex had abused and battered her  At this point  Alex was willing to get a job and and help raise their child before he found out Gilberte had aborted it and planned to marry someone else   By chance  Alexandre meets a nurse nymph called Veronika and they striked up a relationship  Veronika fell in love with Alex for the first time after all the sordid sex she had with men in the past  Marie and Veronika struggles for Alex's affection and had a m  nage    trois to boot  Finally at the end  it's revealed Veronika is pregnant with Alex's child and Alex asked her to marry him  We assume  as aforesaid with Gilberte's situation  Alexandre will even get a job and be the provider for his new found love and family  There is hope   With the title of  La Maman et la putain   I deduce Jean Eustache was relating to Fran  oise Lebrun's character of Veronika  She was a whore and then she became the mother  Hence  the mother and whore is the same person  Anyway  what do I know  French films are mostly  not all  very chatty  aimlessly political  preaching  theatrical  insipid  lamenting and full of quotes  Lebrun and L  aud played their obdurate characters well and held the film together as some part of the script became a little lost and disjointed   Not a bad effort  7 10
