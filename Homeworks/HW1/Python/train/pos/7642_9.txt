Not really a big box office draw  but I was pleasently surprised with this movie  James  I did some things to Farrah Fawcett  Orr  co-wrote and directed this movie about an ordinary  average guy named Larry Burrows who thinks his life would have been incredibly different if he hit a homerun at a key baseball game when he was 15  But thanks to mysterious and magical bartender Mike  Larry gets his wish  yet soon realizes that his new life isn't exactly as he hoped it would be  I must say  this movie really impressed me  Critics have given it mixed  and I must say the concept is really interesting and pulled off well  Yes  it is a little standard  but packs enough funny moments  drama and excellent acting to make it really good  James Belushi  I think  was Oscar worthy for his role  Jon Lovitz is perfect  and Linda Hamilton plus Renee Russo shine in their roles  Michael Caine is perfect as the bartender  It's just a good movie with a good lesson  If you've never seen  I highly recommend you check
