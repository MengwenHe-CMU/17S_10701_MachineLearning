This is the one movie to see if you are to wed or are a married couple  The movie portrais a couple in Italy and deals with such difficult topics as abortion  infidelity  juggling work and family  The so called  culture of death  that we are experiencing nowadays in the world is terrible and this movie will surely make you think  A must see  I hope it gets distributed as it should  Congratulations on the cast and director  Two thumbs up and a 10 star evaluation from me
