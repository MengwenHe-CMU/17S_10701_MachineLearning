An excellent cast makes this movie work  all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it's clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie  It's not quite the comedy I expected  much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor  For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny  I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies  but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I can't help it  imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big -- and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later
