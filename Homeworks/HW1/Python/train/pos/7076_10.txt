A very strong movie  Bruce is good and Brad also  As I think there are two cities missed in the receptionist list from the list Bruce remembered  That means the woman was a real insurance and she did her job  Well  Novikov property seems to me work in this movie  However  I do believe in Back to the future theory of worlds' multiplicity  So Bruce could save the world  but not his world  In the theory of parallel worlds the man can meet himself  And I do believe there is no problem in that  Here I disagree with Dr  Brown from Back    But the story pf 12 Monkeys has its own beauty  Inspite of all these theories of one world or many or continuum one can believe that he is really insane and the doctor - his girlfriend was just lost  A sequence of events which may lead her to believe that he is from the future  The bullet - well it might be some mistake  some falsification  Well I like this movie - has to buy a DVD  Best
