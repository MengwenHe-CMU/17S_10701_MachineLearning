Well here comes another well romantic comedy   but unlike all others movies of this genre this is by far the best I have seen in a long while   I'll admit at first I wanted to watch this movie because of Megan Fox and a little because of Simon Pegg    First of all if you have watched a decent amount of movies you will know that Sidney and Alison would be together at the and of the movie one way or another   but from the beginning to the end of the movie you won't know how    Okay now this movie is just made for Simon Pegg I can't see any other actor in the role of Sidney and I'm sure this would be a very weaker movie if not for Pegg's great performance  There is a number of great gags and jokes in this movie that kept me laughing really hard courtesy of Simon Pegg's character Sidney   but I think everyone in this movie is good For example Kirsten Dunst is really solid in this movie  I usually don't think of her as any more than an average actress but she was really good in this one   then there's Jeff Bridges there's Gillian Anderson and of course Megan Fox who plays spoiled bitchy star Sophie Maes   great role for her    All in all while I usually don't agree with ratings her on IMDb this time I would completely agree with them    Go and see this movie it is really light-hearted and positive and I recommend it deeply    My rating 7 out of 10   well 7 5 actually
