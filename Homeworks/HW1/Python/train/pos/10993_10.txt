This movie is a Gem because it moves with soft  but firm resolution  I caution viewers that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms Liu is there  it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace  It's NOT about explosions  car chases  or flying bullets  You must be patient and instead  note the details here  It's sedate because that's what the Main Character is  The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds  I will not give spoilers-- because that destroys the point of watching  The plot is what you've read from the other postings  an average white-collar guy  seeking change and adventure  signs on for a corporate spy job  Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data   Take it from there  This movie starts at a surreal walk-- with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential  underlying suburban paranoia  Then it begins to accelerate  The acting on all parts is superb-- and yes  some of the acts are caricature characters  But they all fit  and they entertain  And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft  soft key sinister theme  All is not right at the beginning  And at the end  All is not what it seems  Get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one-- and turn up the sound  This movie wants you to LISTEN
