An excellent movie about two cops loving the same woman  One of the cop  P  rier  killed her  but all the evidences seems to incriminate the other  Montand   The unlucky Montand doesnt know who is the other lover that could have killed her  and P  rier doesnt know either that Montand had an affair with the girl  Montand must absolutely find the killer   and what a great ending  Highly recommended
