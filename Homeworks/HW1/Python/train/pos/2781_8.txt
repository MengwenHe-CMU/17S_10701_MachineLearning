This was an adorable movie  A real feel-good movie when you need one  The story is light  this is no Gone With the Wind  but sometimes  one needs this kind of plot  Funny and warm characters  fantastic acting and beautiful costumes wardrobe  Parminder K  Nagra  also from the TV show ER  is WONDERFUL in this role  She is definitely a new shining star for Hollywood  All should keep an eye on her  she's going to be BIG in the future  Also impressing was the soundtrack for this movie  A nice mix of modern and Indian tunes  I was dancing throughout most of the movie  Highly recommended if a fun movie is what you need
