i just saw this movie on TV   i've lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me   i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt   the feeling of wanting to see her father again   wanting to talk to him   or at least given the chance to say goodbye   and i'm so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her   saying that her father read her letter  and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn't a shop in heaven   it just lets me feel that miracles do exist
