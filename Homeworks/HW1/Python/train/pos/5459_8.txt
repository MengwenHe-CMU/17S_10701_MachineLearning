BABY FACE is a fast paced  wise cracking  knowing smirk of a film that lasts only an hour and 15 minutes  but oh what a smart 75 minutes they are  That a story that covers so much ground could be told in such a short time puts most of today's movie makers to shame  Screenwriters of today should study the economy of BABY FACE and cut the bloat that overwhelms so many of their films   The story is no nonsense  An amoral woman rises to wealth first under  and then over the bodies of the men who fall madly in love with her  Sure the production code loused it up with a redeeming  happy ending  but it isn't hard to see in which the direction the writers wanted to go  so enjoy what's there and use your imagination for the rest  Stanwyck is terrific as is George Brent and Douglass Dumbvrille as a hapless suitor  Not a great film but certainly an enjoyable one  If you've never seen BABY FACE catch it the next time it's shown on cable or rent the cassette  It's worth the effort
