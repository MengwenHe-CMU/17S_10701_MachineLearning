Buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when  humanizing  animals  and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them  Based on a true story  Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other  and that they will do anything for each other  While not a perfect movie  the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children  This film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets  but does show the difficulties  A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions
