WOW  One of the greatest movies I have EVER - EVER seen  Absolutely LOVED it  Before the opening credits were done I was glued to the screen  It's a Sci-Fi thriller - AND edge of your seat Whodunnit  Incredible  I wish'd it would never end  Lucy Liu is a throwaway role  Anyone could have played it  The lead actor  Jeremy Northram was the perfect geeky guy   This movie appeals to me who loved War Games  Sneakers  and Track Down  Incredible  8-22-06  Walt D in LV
