The man who directed 'The Third Man' also directed the 'Who Will Buy' sequence in  Oliver   Now that is talent  I raise my hat to Carol Reed  I know there are 'second units' involved  but still     And he had to deal with Orson Welles and Oliver Reed     I suppose quality will out   It does show in the final scene with Nancy   avoiding spoiler - everyone has to see Oliver  for the first time sometime     How many lines do I need to type  Encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouraged  I hope this counts as the  10th line
