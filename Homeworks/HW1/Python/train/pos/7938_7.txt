Rob Estes  Josie Bisset and a crap load of kids that look nothing like either of them  Basically  Rob and Josie have a shotgun wedding on a drunken night during a Vegas vacation  They each come home to find that their respective children already know of the nuptials due to tabloid-like not-so-fodder  They  Rob and Josie  move both of them and their eight kids into one or the other's house  Rob builds furniture  I think  which is close enough to Frank Lambert's  Patrick Duffy  construction job on the much similar Step by Step to warrant eternal mockage  Josie is some sort of cookie-making queen  though it doesn't look like she makes any of the cookies  Not close enough to Carol Foster's  Suzanne Somers hairdressing job to warrant likeness mockage  but hilariously preposterous enough to warrant atrocity mockage  Unlike Step by Step  they were a couple before the vacation and actually knew one another's last names  or so one assumes if their serious enough about a relationship to take a trip together  Anyhow  there are eight kids  Moira  Sandy  Jeff  Lily  Daisy  Nathan  Andrew L  and Andrew B  I  personally  think they should've just called the younger Andrew 'Andy'  There's a lot of product placement  particularly for Soup at Hand  Which is disgusting  and Listerine Pocket Packs  There are also some stupid  senseless moments  It's also not a great film to promote happy families  But  hey  Rob Estes  This concludes my review of 'Step By Step    on some really bad drugs ' Watch it for Rob Estes and his pretty eyes  There are some great pretty eyes shots
