Another Spanish movie about the 1936 Civil War  This time we're told about the story of Carol  lovely played by d  butant Clara Lago   a little girl which comes to live to a little Spanish village from New York  It is such an initiating trip  and soon she'll find about the injustices of the human race  their stupid fights and conflicts  their contradictions  Imanol Uribe makes his best film since  D  as Contados   1994  with such a sober pulse  a beautiful photography  and a nice script  He tries not to take part in the conflict  he just shows us some facts and let us decide  ok  the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in  and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple  Clara Lago and Juan Jos   Ballesta  A well cared production  My rate  7 10
