I love this movie like no other  Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated  but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue  which  please remember  is all tongue in cheek  Aussies and Poms will understand  everyone else-well   title song lyric  he can sink a beer  he can pick a queer  in his latest double-breasted Bondi gear    another song lyric   All pommies are bastards  bastards  or worse  and England is the a  e-hole of the universe    during a television interview on an  arty program    Mr Mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you've been in England   Barry's response Flamin' bull-artists   while chatting up a naive young pom girl   Mr Mackenzie  I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia   Barry's response  Abos  I've never seen an Abo in me life  Mum does most of the solid yacca  ie hard work  round our place  This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser Aussie flick  If you can get a copy of it  watch and enjoy
