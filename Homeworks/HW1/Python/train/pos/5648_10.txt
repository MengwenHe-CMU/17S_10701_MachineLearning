I recently purchased the complete American Gothic series on DVD and it lived up to my memories of it  I was very grateful to be able to view for the first time episodes that were never televised  I loved  Ring of Fire  in particular of the stories I hadn't seen the first time around  Gary Cole is fantastic as  evil  sexy  Lucas Buck  Lucas Black as Caleb is also a superb player  I thought Brenda Bakke as Selena Coombs was also superb in her portrayal  In fact  the whole cast was fantastically talented and had great chemistry with each other  It's a shame the series was screwed by the network  in collusion with a burgeoning group of censors  because it was truly designed for adult viewing  A mixture of comedy  tragedy  farce  satire  Gothic romance and horror genres  it offered brilliant characterizations supported by acting at the genius level  I had the most tremendous lust for the devil for once in my life  Long live Gary Cole  Sheriff Lucas Buck   the most luscious  fallen angel  ever
