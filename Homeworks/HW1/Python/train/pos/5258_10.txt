The Ladies Man is laugh out loud funny  with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes  including the funniest love song ever written   Ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role  Tim Meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you'll find in any comedy out there  It is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every 6 months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round  I am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre 4 7  10 and i urge you to vote   And remember kids-  Theres more motion in the ocean
