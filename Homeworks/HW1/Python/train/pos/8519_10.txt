Astounding     This may have been A poor attempt at remaking the already recreated Omen Movie  but I sure enjoyed it  That last Man who commented is a fool  This Movie was one of a kind  And the Music Dark  Jerry Goldsmith Himself  would had applaud this Movie  Great recommendations from Myself to Watch or Buy this Film  I collect horror Movies and Soundtracks  So listen to what I have to say  not that other idiot  There is only one thing that do not fascinate Me  the endings  According to Prophecy it is all inaccurate  Including Final conflict  and Left behind  But My conclusion being     There great Movies   and should be seen  before the Great Depression falls upon Us  and Before the Democrats Take over the Presidency too  So Signed    Jacob Eder   A Farmer  with A Mastermind
