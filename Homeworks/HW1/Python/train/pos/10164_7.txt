This is a great film  I agreed to watch a chick flick and some how ended up with this  I had never heard of it or anyone in it  excpet Mike from Friends   But it is great  Eva  Lake and Paul give amazing performances  The humour is consistently dry and witty  Paul Rudd pretty much plays the mike character from Friends  which works great   The other characters are stereotypes and the plot is formulaic  I mean we are not talking 'Apocalypse Now' here  But the characters are likable  the story is engaging  the soundtrack  production and direction all work well  In all a great feel-good film that really deserves a lot more credit than it gets  Everyone has their own tastes but I really don't understand the one star reviews for this
