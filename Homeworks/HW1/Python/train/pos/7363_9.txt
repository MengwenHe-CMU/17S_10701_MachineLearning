This is Not a Love Song  My one word summary of this film would be  Excellent'  It probably won't appeal to the mass movie watching public    it's a film that forces you to participate  You observe  think  and question  Comparisons could be made with Deliverance  Topic Theme  and perhaps with The Blair Witch Project for overall filming style  However this film stands unique against both  The cinematography effects  solarisation  freeze frame  blur etc  have been seen before but they are used most effectively in this film to underpin the natural tension of the story  Acting is raw  menacing and utterly believable  The real theme of the film is about friendship  the title really gives the game away  It's probably not the kind of friendship that most of us have experienced or indeed would want to  It is a love song
