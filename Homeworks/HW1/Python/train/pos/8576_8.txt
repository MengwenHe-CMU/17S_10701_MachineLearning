Hollow Point  though clumsy in places  manages to be an extremely endearing and amusing action movie  The primary entertainment value here is humor - everyone turns in clever performances that provide the film with a great deal of energy  Oh  by the way  advocates of gun safety will be horrified by the conduct of the characters in this movie
