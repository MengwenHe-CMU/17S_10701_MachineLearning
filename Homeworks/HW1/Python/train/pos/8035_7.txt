Sunday would not be Sunday without an action movie  and when you want intense combat  you turn to Tom Berenger  Platoon   Here he plays a sniper in the jungle going after rebels and drug lords  Life's a bitch  so he gets a green office type  Billy Zane  to help on the mission  The film is in the hands of Luis Llosa  who stunk up Anaconda  he doesn't do much better here  but Berenger makes the movie worthwhile  Sure  it may be a little long - who wants to see a lot of walking through the jungle  but is is good  tense action when the time is right
