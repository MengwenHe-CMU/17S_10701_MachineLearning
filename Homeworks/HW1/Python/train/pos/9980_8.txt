Any movie that shows federal PIGs  Persons In Government  to be the power-mad threats they are in real life has a lot to recommend it to me  Alas  the script supervision and editing and even  at times  the directing are flawed so there will be people who will disparage the whole movie and ignore the good moments  I saw the original way back when it was new and hated it  despised it  loathed it  Thought it was a terrible  irrational piece of junk  Now  though  I don't remember why  I believe the two should not be compared or even connected  Consider them as two different movies  Rate them as two different movies  This  Vanishing Point  provides a rallying place  a banner for people who want to encourage individualism  who believe in human rights  who recognize the threat to freedom government can be and is  especially the federal government   The Voice  wears a cap bearing the state motto of New Hampshire   Live Free or Die   At one time it would have been the motto of most Americans  Despite its obvious flaws   Vanishing Point  is a film to cheer
