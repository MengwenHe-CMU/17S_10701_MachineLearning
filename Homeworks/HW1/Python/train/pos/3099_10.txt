Along with  Brothers   Sisters    Six Degrees  was one of my favorite new dramas of fall 2006   Great cast all around  but really enjoyed the work of Campbell Scott  the come-back photog  and Hope Davis  recent widow of journalist killed in Iraq   Aside from the acting  the writing was fresh and the acting superb  The show was also shot in NYC  the real city  not the Warner Bros  or some other studio's backlot  adding a secondary layer or realism   I guess people are more interested in the latest  Survivor  and other reality garbage  Too bad it didn't last
