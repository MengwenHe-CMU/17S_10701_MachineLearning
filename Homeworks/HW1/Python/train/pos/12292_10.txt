I love this movie  Jouvet  Arletty  Blier  Carn      almost everything has already been said about the movie  but there is one detail I'd like to shed some light onto  no footage of the real  still standing  H  tel du Nord  is it still  I heard it was to be demolished     has been used for the movie - the whole scene has been rebuilt on set  the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks
