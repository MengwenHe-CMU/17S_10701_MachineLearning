It's a cooking competition show  Americanized  It's not going to be the Japanese version  The show is great  I could care less about cooking but this show is just entertaining to watch    From the intensity put into the dishes by the chef to the goofy chairman  Truly a good way to spend some time watching TV   You could critique the show for having guests like Marc Ecko as a judge    But    Meh  It's entertaining enough to watch and generally the winner deserves the prize   Oh yeah and I'm bitter John Besh isn't the new Iron Chef     Ala Cuisine
