Not many reviews  hence thought i would add one  DO NOT GO BY THE OTHER REVIEWS  This was a excellent movie  RKS is one of the very few Indian directors that can actually put together a really good movie  AB and Akshay given yet another example of great acting  as does bhoomika too  which was a little unexpected  but great to watch  Am surprised there has not been much hype around release  Or filmfare other awards nominations  considering how good the movie was  Better then Khakee i thought and i thought Khakkee too was good movie  Is a fairly long movie  but definitely worth it and while watching it  definitely does seem long  Cant wait for RKS next movie and the next AB  Akshay movie they always seem to do well together    e g  waqt  Bhoomika too has acted really well in the movie and should do really well if she continue in the same fashion in the future
