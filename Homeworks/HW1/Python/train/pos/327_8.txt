I've read one comment which labeled this film  trash  and  a waste of time   I think this person got their political undies tugged a bit too much  I just rented the new Criterion DVD's of both Yellow and Blue  These films--although hardly great--have at least become of historical interest as to the so-called  radical student political-social movement of the late '60s  I hadn't seen either picture and from their notorious reputation  I was expecting some real porn  there isn't any   There is frontal nudity  including the still verboten frontal male nudity  automatic NC-17--the Orwellian-X  in the U S  But I wasn't expecting the films in-your-face democratic socialist message   Though it tends to the simplistic   I thought it occassionally made its points well  Both films occassionally had me laughing out loud and the director's commentary made it clear there was plenty of parody in the film  Especially the supposedly  pornographic  sex scenes  The first such scene is very realistic  The lead couple is clumsy  inept  funny and endearing in their first copulation scene  The second--which caused the most complaints--has faked cunnilingus and fellatio  And the last is the end of an angry fight  that is believable  The extras include an informative introduction to the film  an interview with the original American distributor and his attorney  excerpts from trial testimony in the U S  and a  diary  commentary by the director on some scenes  This is the film that  blue noses  wouldn't let alone and led to the pivotal  prurient interest with no social redeeming value  standard that  thankfully  still stands  Those with an interest in the quirks of history will find this a must see
