I've seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago   I must admit  it was a really good Western which features 2 of the big names   On one side  there's Charlton Heston  playing the infamous and retired lawman Samuel Burgade  On the other   The late James Coburn playing the villainous Zach Provo   seeking revenge on Burgade no matter what the cost    The good thing about this film was there was some really good characters   Most of the actors played it out really well   Especially James Coburn  who I find that he was really mean in this film   But that how it was   Christopher Mitchum  who I've seen everywhere in other films   Playing Hal Brickman   I felt his character was left out in the cold  but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with Burgade  to bring down Provo's posse's  All in all  it was a great film   Very good to watch   Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith   Wonderful piece of Western persona    8 out of 10
