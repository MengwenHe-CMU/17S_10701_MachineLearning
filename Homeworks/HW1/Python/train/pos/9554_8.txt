Lock Up Your Daughters is one of the best high-spirited comedies I have ever seen  It is misunderstood since it lacks the  social commentary  values that many films of the day  1969  required to be successful  The characters are over-the-top satires of everyday people and played to that purpose by all of the actors  Christopher Plummer shines especially bright as Lord Foppington  a noble with hair too big to fit in the door  The plot involves the usual 18th century stuff  mistaken identities  thwarted romances  corrupt government officials  and jokes at every turn  It answers the questions  What happens when 4 rambunctious  eager to party sailors are on leave in a small British coastal town  And  who do they get involved with and how does it all turn out  Despite doing poorly at the box office  it has great costumes  excellent music based on the Mermaid Theatre musical of the same name   great lively acting and sets that are obviously authentic  That it has never been released on either VHS or DVD is truly a shame  since so many bad movies are released every day
