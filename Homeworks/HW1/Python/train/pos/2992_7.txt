It appears even the director doesn't like this film but for me I think he's being a bit harsh on himself  Sure it's not perfect  but there are some atmospheric shots and the story is good enough to keep you interested throughout  It's shot in what appears to be quite a pretty village which adds to the atmosphere as well  If you like horror films shot in England  give it a go  I have just seen a trailer for this directors latest film 'The Devil's Chair' which looks quite amazing  There aren't enough English horror films for me  so any that come along deserve our attention  and this one isn't as bad as you may think
