I love this movie  My only disappointment was that some of the original songs were changed  It's true that Frank Sinatra does not get a chance to sing as much in this movie but it's also nice that it's not just another Frank Sinatra movie where it's mostly him doing the singing  I actually thought it was better to use Marlon Brando's own voice as he has the voice that fits and I could not see someone with this great voice pulling off the gangster feel of his voice  Stubby Kaye's  Sit Down  You're Rockin' the Boat  is a foot-tappin'  sing-a-long that I just love  He is a hard act to follow with his version and I still like his the best  Vivian Blaine is just excellent in this part and  Adelaide's Lament  is my favorite of her songs  I really thought Jean Simmons was perfect for this part  Maybe I would not have first considered her but after seeing her in the part  it made sense  Michael Kidd's choreography is timeless  If it were being re staged in the year 2008  I would not change a thing  I find that many times something is lost from the stage version to the movie version but this kept the feel of the stage  even though it was on film  I thought the movie was well cast  I performed in regional versions of this and it's one of my favorites of that period
