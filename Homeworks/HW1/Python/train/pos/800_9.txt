I couldn't have been more thrilled  Just eight years old back in 1983  I was going to see a Star Wars movie at the theater  The best day of my life was about to happen  To that time  my only Star Wars experience had been a few HBO showings of Star Wars  I hadn't even seen The Empire Strikes Back yet  And boy  did that day deliver for my less critical eyes  Jabba  Big Rebel spaceships  The Emporer  A green-bladed lightsaber   Wow  Since that magical day  I must have watched this movie hundreds of times  I can't even form an accurate estimate at this point  With those multiple viewings  I have of course observed that this movie - the REAL Episode III - does have its flaws  Of course in the context of a Star Wars movie  those  flaws  are more like  quirks   Millions had had their magical day in 1977 and 1980  In May of 1983  I had mine  And this was my Star Wars movie
