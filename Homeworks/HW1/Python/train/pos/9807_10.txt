I remember this series so well  It was excellent - such strong and compelling characters  stylish and sexy     and so different to everything else on offer at the time - and now     I am sure that it inspired the also excellent Canadian drama  Traders    Both season 1 and season 2 are available on DVD region 2 in the UK  Its a treat to watch the series again  Season 1 is 13 episodes and season 2 seems to be 10 episodes  Unfortunately  it seems to have ended after 2 seasons  This series was a lot of fun  Sometimes you can get it on special at Amazon co uk
