A great film  Slow  YES     but original  deeply atmospheric  dark and horrifying  perfectly SURREAL  feels like a nightmare   I'd compare it to David Lynch  Eraserhead  Inland Empire  Blue Velvet  style maybe with mixed with a little bit of Barton Fink and Naked Lunch  Insects    Also a bit of Jodorowsky  Fando y Lis      Add some Night on Earth  Angel Heart and a bit of Begotten  Pi   would it be wrong to mention Tetsuo   Jacob's Ladder  Barker's The Forbidden and Salome - that should form together at least the concept of a dark night    NUIT NOIRE  If you're out for avantegardistic and or surrealistic cinema  like I am  you're gonna like this one  If you're expecting anything else like a movie full of action with some average plot - try your luck with something else  Final words  The plot is very  very strange and unusual and that's probably the  1 reason why most people who don't appreciate this film hate it
