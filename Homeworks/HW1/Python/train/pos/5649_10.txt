I'm watching the series again now that it's out on DVD  yay   It's striking me as fresh  as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired  The central performances are gripping  the scripts are layered  I'll stick my neck out and put it up there with The Prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035  I've been asked to write some more line  it seems IMDb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever  Pithy and to the point is clearly not the IMDb way   Well  unlike IMDb's submissions editors  American Gothic understands that simplicity is everything  In 22 episodes  the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons  On top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation  When the show first aired  I was still grieving for Twin Peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off  Personally I'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years  Reckon it don't get more controversial than that
