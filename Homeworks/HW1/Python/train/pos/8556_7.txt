This movie is plain fun I has nothing to do with the original America Pie  but it is fun to watch  Another try  but better than Band camp and The naked mile  at least funnier  Just after first five minutes i was laughing my ass out  so I decided to call my friend and we would watch it together We had a few beers and we had fun  You will not find any deep message in this movie  but it's worth watching  So  lay back and just enjoy
