This is a film I saw when it first came out  and which I have seen a few more times over the years  It's always enjoyable  One thing is that the comedy does not take sides  it skewers labor and capitalists equally  Only Sid seems outside the classic struggle  even though he's responsible for it   Spoiler warning  do not read further if you haven't seen the film  This is a fantasy  though presented fairly plausibly  Ask yourself  could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric  It would cut through almost any support  Also  when cornered in an alley  Sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield  Cute symbolism  Someday  I'll get this on DVD
