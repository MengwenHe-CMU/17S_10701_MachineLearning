Sean  you know I think that you are absolutely the greatest actor in the world  but I can't commend you for this  Comedy just isn't your strong suit  However  it wasn't all your fault  Some of the stuff was just too hard to understand  Alfred Lynch did a decent job  but you gotta wonder where the lines came from from the beginning  Once again  Sean    I apologize
