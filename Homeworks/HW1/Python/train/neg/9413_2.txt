I wholeheartedly disagree with the other viewers of this wretched film  The only reason why I didn't rate it 1 for awful was due to the great talent of Carmen Miranda  The beginning and end are the best parents due to her gifted singing and dancing  The problem is with the rest of the picture  Alice Faye comes off quite hollow  Don Ameche has a great singing voice but with the wretched writing material  he comes off so terribly corny  The plot is a real stiff here with Ameche assuming two parts as a song and dance man and a baron not happily married to Faye  It seems that by playing the song and dance man  Ameche's marriage gets a second change to reignite  Some silly nonsense about the baron having to clear up business and being away allows him to play both parts  S Z  Sakal is given little to do here and so his comedic gifts are not given the opportunity to shine  Ditto for J  Carrol Naish who actually appears uncomfortable in his role  This is a chica chica boom bomb of a film
