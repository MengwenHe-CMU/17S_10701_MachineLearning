I've seen this movie today for the first time and I never heard of it before  probably because of it's poor message   First of all  the directing itself is quite good  the actors played well and the CGI  I'm not a fan of CGI  is magnificent  But that alone doesn't make a movie  No story at all  no message behind beautiful exploited talents  Or do I have to make people remember  the art of a director is not only your vision but to know how to tell a story  And this is what's missing the whole 7 minutes  There for a simple 4 rating
