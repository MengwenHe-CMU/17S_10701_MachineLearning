To describe this film as garbage is unfair  At least rooting through garbage can be an absorbing hobby  This flick was neither absorbing nor entertaining  Kevin Bacon can act superbly given the chance  so no doubt had an IRS bill to settle when he agreed to this dire screenplay  The mad scientist story of 'Hollow Man' has been told before  been told better  and been told without resorting to so many ludicrously expensive special effects  Most of those special effects seem to be built around the transparent anatomical dolls of men  women and dogs you could buy in the early seventies  In the UK they were marketed as 'The Transparent Man   Woman Dog ' which is maybe where they got the title for this film  Clever special effects  dire script  non-existent plot
