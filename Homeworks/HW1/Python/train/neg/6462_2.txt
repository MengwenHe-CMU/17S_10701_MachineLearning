This wretched movie shows that not even some of Gollywood's best can salvage a true landfill deposit   I could spend much time describing everything that was bad about this effort  but that would require more time and I've already wasted 91 minutes watching   IT  Looking at it now  after Brando's death  shows how tragic the life of one of our greatest actors had become  Donald Sutherland  Why   I have to fill more lines to get this accepted  I have to fill more lines to get this accepted  I have to fill more lines to get this accepted  Don't waste your time with this movie  I'm overdue to do something interesting  Bye
