Spooks is enjoyable trash  featuring some well directed sequences  ridiculous plots and dialogue  and some third rate acting  Many have described this is a UK version of  24   and one can see the similarities   The American version shares the weak silly plots  but the execution is so much slicker  sexier and I suspect  expensive  Some people describe weak comedy as  gentle comedy    This is gentle spy story hour  the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre  Give me Smiley any day
