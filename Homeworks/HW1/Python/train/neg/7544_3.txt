First this movie was not that bad It was entertaining   at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons  I have never seen the original so can't compare the two  This movie reminded me of that weird Christopher Reeve movie Village of the Damned  THe two movies have different plots  but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both  The wicker man is suppose to be a mystery thriller men please don't anger the women movie  I don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off  Nicholas Cage  his glorious bad self goes to a secluded Island called Summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fianc  e who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders   Cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world  Stupid  Things get weirder when the large Amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl  His fianc  e is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time  Cage stays on the Island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival  In this movie males do not fare so well  A sick twisted display of feminism   I found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit  I think there were too many potholes in this movie  I find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining  but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird  While most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism  I would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed  This movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice  It is NOT a thriller it should be categorized as just strange
