This  documentary  is a proof of talent being used for mean purposes  The fact that it is financed by the venezuelan government gives it a lack of legitimacy in the purpose of searching for the truth of what really happened those horrible days of April 2002 in Venezuela  something even we venezuelans don't know for sure  There are ways of lying  and the directors of this stuff lie both by omission and by knowledge   The venezuelan political process is too complex to be easily understood by foreign audiences  and they take advantage of that  For instance  POSSIBLE SPOILERS  they show pro-Ch  vez demonstrators shooting at an empty street  what the hell they did that for   in a way of saying they didn't kill anyone  but didn't bother showing the images we all saw here  of opposition demonstrators  and a journalist  falling dead or injured at the other side of that  empty  street  They can't explain why the chopper of the political police was the only one authorised to fly over Caracas that day and did nothing against the snipers that were all over the roofs of the buildings nearby the presidential palace  something that would exhibit how inefficient would be the security measures to guard the President  A few days after the  coup   the chief of the military guard in charge was asked at the National Assembly  our Congress  why didn't they act against the snipers and he said  'cause they weren't there to act against the president   isn't that a confession  There is so much more  the fact that the highest rank military announced that Ch  vez had resigned and 2 days later he said he had lied because  that's politics  and nowadays is the Minister of Internal Affairs of Ch  vez' administration  It would take me thousands of words to explain all the lies depicted in this  documentary   made with the intention of selling the world an image of the good old Hugo Ch  vez who rules for the poor and the bad rich opposition that wants him out at all costs  when the truth is that 60-70  of people rejects his government  and that percentage includes the poor  I hope those of you who have seen and bought this will be able to see a different version that is being made by a group of venezuelan people showing no less than 30 lies  Nazi propaganda has returned
