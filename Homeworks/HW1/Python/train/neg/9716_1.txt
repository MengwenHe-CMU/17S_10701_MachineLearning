This is  without doubt  one of the worst films I've ever seen    The plot is so full of holes  the story is like a bad remake of a bad suspense movie and the actors sound like were reading directly from the manuscript for the first time  Worst of all is Steve Guttenberg  He plays his character like he was in  Police Academy  - the same foolish womanizer - and that's not suited for a leading man in what should have been a thriller  It's really hard to believe that Hanson would make  L A  Confidential  ten years later    Avoid this like the plague
