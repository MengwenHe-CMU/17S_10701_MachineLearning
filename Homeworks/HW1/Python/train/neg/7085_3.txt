I really tried to like this movie  It deals with an important problem in any society  sex addiction  In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex  In this case  our main character and hero  for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women  crazy  kinky  neurotic  puts in jeopardy his marriage  job  and even his life  The production values are terrible  mainly the acting  Oh  you won't enjoy ANY of the sex scenes  most of them are done in very poor taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick  Second  the plot is just non sense  How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband  How could she believe him   The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while  Also  the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just pointless and will leave you thinking  wtf     Scenes like those you will find plenty   Avoid this movie  Please  avoid it  it's not soft core  it's not a documental  it's not a dramatic feature  It's a pretentious effort form a so called documentary director or whatever  Only Mrs  Kinski's legs on display are worth the watch  I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I didn't spend my money on it  But those 90 minutes of my life won't come back
