I just saw this film yesterday  My girlfriend wanted to see it only because of Richard Gere  I feel I wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor actress is in it  I hope she learned the lesson because I had trouble keeping her in her seat  As of me  since I paid already  I wanted to see the end at least  just in the hope something good would turn up  but I didn't hold my breath  and luckily so cause I would have been a victim of the film just the same  This is not a black and white film  it's a black and black one  The main character  Richard Gere  is almost as bad as his registrants  and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad  Speak of a clich   and the exploitation of a typical US phobia  Richard Gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best  Totally unconvincing for the job  The film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap  dramatic  and sensational turn that just is unreal  They just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders  vigilante beating  rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous  They even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get  I gather the film won't come out in the USA and will go straight to DVD  That's were it should have stayed in other countries too  but because it's Hollywood and Richard Gere they just had to show it  Believe me  without Gere  the film is not even worth a B-series movie
