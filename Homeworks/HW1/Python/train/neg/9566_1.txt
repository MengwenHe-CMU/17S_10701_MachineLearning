I see a lot of movies  Saw the original wargames years ago and loved it  Computers where still  a big mystery  for the most of us and the movie was convincing  in it's own way  This one  however  looks like a low budget Wednesday night special  Total crap  from start to finish  The plot is so weak  you won't believe it until you see the movie  which I would not recommend in the first place   I can not point out one actor that actually did a good job in this movie  But hey  with that script I would've been surprised if ANYONE could do a good job acting  Lots of clich   scenes  CGI looks like it's taken out of the '86 version  Bah  no  I'm getting in a bad mood just writing about this  Do NOT watch this movie  Life's to short to waste it on watching crappy movies
