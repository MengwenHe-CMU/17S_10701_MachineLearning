And so the great rewriting of history continues Hollywood style  This was senseless ridiculous rubbish  Its shocks me that such an amazing amount of money can be spent to produce what is the most contrived  poorly acted inaccurate film I have ever seen  It is appalling  Nic Cage's brief flirtation with serious acting appears to be over  I can only assume that Leaving Las Vegas was a glitch in an otherwise litany of dreadful films  Diane Kruger proves that her performance in Troy was no fluke  she really can't act  Harvey Keitel should be ashamed of himself for working on such tripe  Only recommended for those either recovering from a recent lobotomy or people of an opinion that America invented the world
