Who in their right mind does anything so stupid as this movie  Accidental killing of a security guard    characters that are so two dimensional that a two year old could have painted drawn them    and better    A red toolbox of death  Please     Hypothermic weak thugs    Acting from hell    Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy  thriller  voyeurism and    female      uhm  Rambo  Unbelievable and it's an insult to any thinking person  Do not watch  walk away it's more horrible than you may imagine    And on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence    Mrs Montford  Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny  this is just pathetic and terrible  Good luck next time   -
