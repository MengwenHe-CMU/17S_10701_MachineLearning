This crap is like watching paint dry  I'm so disappointed because I was so eager to see it  There simply is no meaning to this film  If it were never made  no one would notice or care  It's hyped up because of all the big names in it  but if  nobody's  were in  nobody would give this film any love  Seriously  I was at the point where half-way through the film I would look at Vanessa Redgrave and think   Hurry up and die already   This is like the  Joy Luck Club  without any of the friggin' joy  It's the  Ocean's 13   nothing but a big-named cast  of mother-daughter movies and completely anti-climatic   oh until it's finally over  I'm sure they'll all be nominated for Oscars    - 4 stars for cinematography and the ability to convince great actresses to commit to this junk
