There are no spoilers in this review  There's nothing to spoil  No plot  nothing  most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch  but this didn't even do that  Clips  three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips    OK  so perhaps they were short on production time  but they'd have been better off skipping this episode entirely  What a waste of time  I'm not sure how this got made  in fact  Scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes  but somehow this got through     Thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode
