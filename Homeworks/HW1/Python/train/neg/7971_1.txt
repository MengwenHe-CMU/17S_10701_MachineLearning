I am not sure who is writing these glowing reviews for this movie but trust me it STKINKS  I have seen hundreds of horror films and slasher flicks and this one is LAME it is only about 80min long and believe me that is all I could take  Plot is terrible  acting is even worse  And there is no development at all  Even the David Cocteau films are better than this  RUN AWAY from JIGSAW   I expected to hate the acting  which can be forgiven in direct to video movies  if the plot is good  This had no scares  very little Gore  and a truly unattractive cast  I watched this with three other friends who I hope are still talking to me  They wanted me to fling the disc out the window  I can not believe anyone could have given this tripe a good review
