OK  I bought this film from Woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday  because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it  But we decided it to watch it anyway  Just for hilarity purposes  And I'm sorry  but this has got to be  one of THE worst films in history  It began off alright  and we thought  Ok this might actually be OK   But after about 10 minutes  we were sadly mistaken  It began when the  mysterious paint baller  turned out to be the most obvious character  the Scouser Australian  I say that because he had an accent which couldn't be identified   who's acting might I just say  was abysmal  Then it got to the end  and by that time  we had all lost the will to live  The paint ball finals  The only thing I did like about this plot is that they didn't actually win  but annoyingly enough they won by default  And I know this has nothing to do with it  but the name the team were given was just awful  Critical Damage  I mean they could of picked a more awesome name  like  The Destroyers of the Anti-Christ  or something  Or that's what the film should of been called anyway
