The worst movie I have seen since Tera Jadoo Chal Gaya  There is no story  no humor  no nothing  The action sequences seem more like a series of haphazard Akshay Kumar Thumbs-Up advertisements stitched together  Heavily influenced from The Matrix and Kung-Fu Hustle but very poorly executed  I did not go a lot of expectations  but watching this movie is an exasperating experience which makes you wonder  What were these guys thinking       The only thing you might remember after watching it is an anorexic Kareena in a bikini  The reason why I did not give a rating of '1' is that every time I think I have seen the worst  Bollywood proves me wrong
