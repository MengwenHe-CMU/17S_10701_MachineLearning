The first movie is pretty good  This one is pretty bad  Recycles a lot of footage  including the opening credits and end title  from Criminally Insane  The new footage  shot on video  really sticks out as poorly done  Scenes lack proper lighting  the sound is sometimes nearly inaudible  there's even video glitches like the picture rolling and so on  Like all bad sequels  it basically just repeats the story of the first one  Ethel kills everybody who shares her living space  often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants  At least it is only an extra on the DVD for the first one  which also includes the same director's film Satan's Black Wedding  Too bad it doesn't include the Death Nurse movies though
