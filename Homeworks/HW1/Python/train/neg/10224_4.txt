Spoilers  Well  the one line summary says it all  Melville  s  Le samurai  is the original and there are elements of  Leon   And they are better - much better  In the  Samurai  Alain Delon is a lonely warrior   professional killer who keeps a bird in cage and is stealing cars for his jobs  with so much suspense in these scenes    Even the end is exactly the same  the samurai seeks death in dignity and is getting shot with an empty gun in his hand  The world has changed he realizes and there is no place for the samurai in it  Delon is not killing so many people like the Ghost dog  But I guess Jarmusch liked  Leon  very much or even  Desperado  by Rodriguez  So he added this  too  And let me guess  the girl will become a professional like Ghost dog  like Natalie Portman in  Leon    So what was Jarmusch thinking after all  Where is the unique  the original thought in this movie  I can  t see the point in making carbon  celluloid  copies  A 4 10 rating by Macaulay Connor
