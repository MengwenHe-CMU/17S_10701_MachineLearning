Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes  I love 50 sci fi  I even love cheesy 50s sci fi  but this film is really  really bad  And not in a MST3K kinda way  Virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best  hip cat  impression of Abott   Costello  Chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi  such as in  Cat Women On The Moon  but it can't in this case  This film requires a mute button and fast forward feature  That said  I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
