Some of these viewer comments are just ridiculous  Not painful to watch with your significant other  I was apologizing to my boyfriend the entire movie   It was so slow and awfully strange   Both Redgraves Vanessa and Natasha were unfit for this  especially with Vanessa doing that ridiculous brash American accent   Claire Danes was the same wiggly-lipped awkward girl that she was in My So-Called Life  She has yet to push herself in any way  Girl  find a new way to pretend to cry   Meryl Streep was one of the only redeeming part of this movie  she was on screen for five minutes  and I swear to God  she reached out of the movie screen and slapped me awake   Oh  And Hugh Dancy  who gets better every time I see him   Glenn Close and Eileen Atkins were also great in their two and a half scenes   I mean  this was a well-shot movie  it was very pretty  the settings were interestingly dressed  providing relief for the intense boredom I was feeling   I don't know  It's just pretty pathetic when a movie that boasts a cast comprised of  The greatest actresses of our time  sucks so much  It sure had more than a few noticeable editing errors  and the main character  Ann  was a huge jerk  I was glad she died  But that's because I felt bad for Lila  Ann's friend -- mostly because these two ladies were better actors and made me feel a little empathy   Ugh  BAD job  Evening the film  You weren't entertaining and you weren't even thought-provoking  I sure hope the book was better  so it didn't waste even more of people's time  3 10
