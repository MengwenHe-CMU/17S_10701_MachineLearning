Power rangers  the moronic merchandising television kids show from the 1990s  has got to be the most pointless and ridiculous television show ever created  What exactly is the point of this show anyway  other than to sell second rate plastic nonsense to children  There is nothing even remotely redeeming or interesting about this show in anyway  Look at the costumes  which look like spandex gone bad  The mullet style hair  earrings  and fashions of the early 1990s look completely ridiculous these days  Avoid this show at all costs
