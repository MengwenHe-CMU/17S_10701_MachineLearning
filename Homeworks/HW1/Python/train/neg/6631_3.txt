Ram Gopal Verma has proved himself as a very innovative and competent director  He had done a remake reworking of Godfather with Sarkar  and succeeded tremendously  Ditto for Lolita which he made as Nishaabd  Sholay is been the movie he repeatedly says has inspired him the most  Unfortunately  he has managed to make a disappointing and ultimately boring remake  The acting ranged from decent to very good  with Amitabh Bachchan being suitably menacing as the villain Babban  The songs were awful and forgettable  The Mehbooba Mehbooba song came off as a second rate music video  The worst part was the pacing  and the dialogues - which were forgettable  Watching the movie in a theatre  I found myself waiting for the intermission  and then for the ending  Some viewers were wise not to wait  and were seen leaving throughout the duration of the film  Ultimately  one of the worst movies made by Ram Gopal Verma
