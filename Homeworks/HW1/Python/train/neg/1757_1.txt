Don't get me wrong  Dan Jansen was a great speed skater  If there was one guy who deserved his gold medal at the Olympics it was Dan  But how can it be possible that Bill Corcoran has made such a bad movie about the incredible Dan Jansen story  because the real Dan Jansen story is truly incredible  Especially when you look at this movie through the eyes of a sportsman everything is wrong  the way Matt Keeslar and the other actors skate  their technique  the dimensions of the speedskating oval  it is all wrong  Shame on you  Bill Corcoran  Dan Jansen deserves better  a lot better  1 out of 10
