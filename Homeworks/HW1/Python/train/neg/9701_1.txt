A really bad sequel  Part 1 had a lot of funny moments - part 2 is just bad  in a boring way  and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fans  Shame on you  Otto Waalkes  The only slightly amusing moment in the film is Helge Schneider who apparently seems to be pis ed about the other characters  It's quite easy to identify with him    The screenplay is sloppy non-existent  The director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately  The acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play   Technically the movie is awful as well  but who can blame the cinematographer sound guys who had to work with such an untalented director
