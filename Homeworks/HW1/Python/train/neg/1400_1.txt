Oh  my gosh   I thought CBS primetime television shows were the worst things Gerald McRaney appeared in    Four people are experimented on by a crazed mind control computer  That's it  don't rent it  I saw this under one of its many titles-  Grey Matter   and it is perhaps one of the worst films of recent memory  The other reviews are right  it is awful  Never have so many establishing shots appeared onscreen  NEVER  The cast is awful  the direction is awful  and the script is awful  I cannot stress how awful this is   Avoid it like you would smallpox  This is rated  PG  for physical violence  some gun violence  mild gore  some profanity  and some adult situations
