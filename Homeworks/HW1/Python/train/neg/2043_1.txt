Awful  awful  awful  A condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make  Once again I'm amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they don't have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crap  I sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Pink was pretty good    I wonder if she has seen this  Watch this at your peril  the boredom may kill you
