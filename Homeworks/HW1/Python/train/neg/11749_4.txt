Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines  At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn't find the jokes or oddness funny anymore  Its a low budget film  thats never a problem in itself   there were some pretty interesting characters  but eventually I just lost interest  I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking  For something similar but better try  Brother from another planet
