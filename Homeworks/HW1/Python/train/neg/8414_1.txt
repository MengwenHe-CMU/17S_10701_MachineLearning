Yeah  Pretty sure I saw this movie years ago when it was about the Supremes  Another recycled storyline glitzed up Hollywood-style  borrowing scripts from better making-it-in-the-music-industry films  Nothing original here  More make-up  glammier costumes and choreography   more money for the questionably  talented  Beyonce draw  If you like the throwback style  you should appreciate actual groups who struggled  without having digitized voices and a Hollywood empire   Beyonce's involvement makes this hypocritical garbage
