I just saw this movie  mainly because Brady Corbet is in it   and I must say that I was not pleased   Of course  the computer graphics were amazing  but the story line needed a little touch-up  Also  I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood  as well if it were rated PG-13   That would definitely attract more people to see it-- teens  What would also attract more teens  particularly teen girls   would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster   Even though the movie had it's down points  I still saw it and thought it was okay
