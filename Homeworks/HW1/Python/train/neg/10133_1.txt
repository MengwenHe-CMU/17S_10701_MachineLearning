Unless you are mentally ill or the most die hard segal fan you will tire of this horrendous excuse for a film in under 5 minutes  The Plot - Even for a Seagal film  the plot is just stupid  I mean its not just bad  its barely coherent  The Acting - Unbelievably wooden  Literally seen better acting in porno's  Ironically this film tries to cash in on this audience which a 'lesbian love scene' which is utterly cringe-worthy  Special Effects - wouldn't look out of place in a 60's sword and sorcery flick  Unless you suffer from insomnia and have exhausted all other cures  don't make the same mistake as i did and buy this DVD  as you will be asking for that hour and a half of your life back
