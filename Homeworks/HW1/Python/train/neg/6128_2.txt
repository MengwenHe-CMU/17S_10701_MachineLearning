This movie was boring   Yes  there are a few funny moments and jokes  but you cannot base a whole movie on that   The characters are too stereotyped  there is no real story - but short episodes with freaky side-characters  who are not freaky enough to make the plot genuine  Shame  because most of the actors are acknowledged in Hungary  a mystery why they took the roles   This is  not  a new hope for the Hungarian film  It was boring  though it was meant to be genuine or unique  They could have tried much more harder than this    2 out of 10
