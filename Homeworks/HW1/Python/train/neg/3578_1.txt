There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie  They took a sleazy story  miscast it  miswrote it  misfilmed it  It has bad dialogue badly performed in a meandering and trashy story  As badly as it fails as art  it fails even worse as commerce  Who could have been the target market for this  What age group  What interest group  Someone should make a movie about how and why they made this movie  That I would pay to see  I've seen thousands of bad movies  and this ranks with  Sailor Who Fell from Grace  and  Manos      my choices as the three most unredeemably bad movies I've ever seen  Everybody associated with it should be forced to make conversation with VanDamme for all eternity  I challenge you  Watch this movie and perform an academic exercise - how could you take this and make it worse  I can't think of one way
