This has to be the worst piece of garbage I've seen in a while  Heath Ledger is a heartthrob  He looked deformed  I wish I'd known that he and Naomi Watts are an item in real life because I spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him   Orlando Bloom is a heartthrob  With the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him  I can't say I agree  Rachel Griffiths was her usual fabulous self  but Geoffrey Rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set   I'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers  This is a far cry from Butch Cassidy  which actually WAS an entertaining film  This was trite  cliche-ridden and boring  We only stayed because we were convinced it would get better  It didn't  The last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious  Heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel  and women and children are dying because of their presence  That's not funny  But it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on  because all we could think of was the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail  I kept waiting for them to say  I'll bite yer leg off   We were howling with laughter  as were several other warped members of the audience  When we left  pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was  I may not have paid cash to see this disaster  sneak preview   but it certainly wasn't free  It cost me 2 hours of my life that I will never get back
