I just didn't get this movie   Was it a musical  no  but there were choreographed songs and dancing in it    Was it a serious drama    no the acting was not good enough for that  Is Whoopi Goldberg a quality serious Actor  Definently not  I had difficulty staying awake through this disjointed movie  The message on apartheid and the  tribute  to the students who died during a student uprosing is noted  But as entertainment this was very poor and as a documentary style movie it was worse  See for yourself  but in fairness I hated it
