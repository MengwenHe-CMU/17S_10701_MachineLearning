Irene Dunne finished her illustrious career with this so-so movie  She should have gone out with a bang  being the classy actress she was  not in this unmemorable  almost unknown film   This lightweight comedy is okay  but nothing special  The first half of it is far better as it gets pretty stupid in the second half  Maybe Irene could see the handwriting on the wall and quit  Even her high-pitched voice got a bit annoying in here  Rumor has it she was not happy with this film  One can see why  The story reminded me of a 1950s television sitcom  Speaking of that  I thought David Nelson from the Ozzie   Harriet TV show was in this movie but it turned out to be a very young Richard Crenna  He looked and sounded just like Nelson  Overall  so-so at best and a sub-par ending for a great actress
