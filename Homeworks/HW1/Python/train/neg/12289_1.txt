I'm gettin' sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one-line synopsis then end up being equal to what you'd find in the bottom center of a compost heap  Who knows   Witchery  may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios  even with a  big name cast   like Blair and Hasselhoff - wink-wink  nudge-nudge  and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef  I dunno  some woman      But on film  it just falls apart faster than a papier-mache sculpture in a rainstorm  Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard  and one of them  a woman  I'd guess  is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque  tortuous ways   Okay  right there you have a cross-section of plots from  The Exorcist    The Omen    Ten Little Indians  and a few other lesser movies in the satanic-worshippers-run-amok line  None of it is very entertaining and for the most part  you'll cringe your way from scene to scene until it's over  No  not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much  They're just in it to pick up a paycheck and don't seem very intent on giving it their  all    From the looks of it  Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson  and who can blame him   and Linda    well  who knows  a celebrity PETA benefit or pro-am golf tour or whatever it is she's in to nowadays  And the torture scenes  Ecchhhh  You'll see people get their mouths sewn shut  dangled up inside roaring fireplaces  strung up in trees during a violent storm  vessels bursting out of their necks  etc  etc  Sheesh  and I thought  Mark of the Devil  was the most sadistic movie I'd seen     Don't bother  It's not worth your time  I can't believe I told you as much as I did  If you do watch it  just see if you can count the cliches  And yes  Blair gets possessed  as if you didn't see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band  No stars   Witchery  - these witches will give you itches
