A short review but    Avoid at all costs  a thorough waste of 90mins  At the end of the film I was none the wiser as to what had actually happened  It's full of cameos  Stephen Fry  3mins   Jack Dee  30 secs   the  Philadelphia  girls  and some vaguely recognisable people but it just doesn't make any sense  Whether the story just got lost in the edit I don't now but jeez    Put on a DVD instead or go to bed and get some rest    2 out of 10  for the cameos and a Morris Minor car chase
