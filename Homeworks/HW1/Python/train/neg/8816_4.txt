I saw mommy   well  she wasn't exactly kissing Santa Clause  he has his hand on her thigh and wicked thoughts in mind  This was enough to emotionally scar a young boy who wanted to believe  He grew up to be a bitter man who was upset at the quality of the toys being made  and the lack of Christmas spirit  Expecting a real slasher flick  I was very disappointed that less than a handful of people dies  and there was no nudity at all  What a bummer  I wanted to like this flick  but it was just too slow and really didn't have a good script  I didn't expect great acting  but I sure wanted some action  There just wasn't any
