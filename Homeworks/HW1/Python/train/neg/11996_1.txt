I have been waiting for this movie a long time  Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this  she's a great actress  This movie contains six stories  It's a new concept flew over from Hollywood  So it's not a new item  1  Khamini  priyanka chopra  is a dancer  She wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her  But then Rahul  Salman Khan  appears and he claims to be her boyfriend  Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress  When she yells  I get annoyed  Salman khan cannot play comic roles  But in his serious parts he is marvelous  2  Vinay  Anil Kapoor  is married to Seema  Juhi Chawla   He gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman  with forgetting what he really has in life  his wife and kids  Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural born actors   actresses  They are great  But this story is to thin for them  3  Shiven  Akshaye Khanna  is going to get married to Gia  Ayesha Takia   but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off  4  Ashutosh  Joh Abraham  is married to Tehzeeb  Vidya Balan   She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss  Now she doesn't know that she loves her husband anymore  5  Raju  Govinda  is a cab driver  He meets Stephani  Shannon Esrechowitz  who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but he is about to get married with an Indian woman  Raju has to bring Staphani to that man  but falls in love with her  I never liked Govinda's movies  He is very annoying  not funny  But in this movie I liked him very much  like he has been growing up the last years  6  Oh yes  There is Sohail Khan  He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati  Isha Koppikar   He want to get some serious action with her  but every time her family comes in between  Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor  but he is funny  I like his movies  Now here's the problem  All these stories aren't interesting  To make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting  Here and there the stories touch each other  but is not significant for the characters  My conclusion  Priyanka cannot act  Loose that woman in the bollywood industry  Sohail Khan should make more movies  this role for him was too small  Salman Khan cannot act comic roles  but real serious movies  That's written on his life as an actor  This movie sucks  and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor  Juhi Chawla  Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham  It's just like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan  and you only let him sing a lullaby
