This must be one of the worst Swedish movies ever made   It is embarrassing that such a bad script was allowed to become a movie and shown in cinemas as recently as year 2006  I've never seen so many visible sponsored products in one and the same movie  It shouldn't be that obvious   I can't understand why so many known actors even thought the idea to even be visible in a movie like this  If I had any respect for some of the known actors in this movie before I saw the movie  it is gone for sure now   I've heard that there will be a follow up movie to this one and I can't understand how that is even possible
