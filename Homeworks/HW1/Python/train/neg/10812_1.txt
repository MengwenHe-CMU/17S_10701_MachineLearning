What a pathetic movie  I won't waste much time commenting about it  I'm still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it  Let me leave it simply with - Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer  He is utterly without talent at both discplines  It's a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs  Much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no-talent that is Shaq
