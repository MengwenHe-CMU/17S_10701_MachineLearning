The secret is   this movie blows  Sorry  but it just did       SPOILER     In this bad riff on I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER and SCREAM  Beth  played admirably by Dorie Barton  joins several friends on a Spring Break trip  The group rents a fancy house and tries to enjoy a fun vacation  Then  the deaths begin  First one then another then another of the friends is murdered  leading to a sad and trite climax with predictable results   One note  Dorie Barton is the poor man's Reese Witherspoon  she looks like Reese  acts like Reese and could pass for Reese in a police lineup  Maybe that's how they cast her  Anyhoo  decent cinematography and fair acting could not quite make up for bad dialog and terrible writing
