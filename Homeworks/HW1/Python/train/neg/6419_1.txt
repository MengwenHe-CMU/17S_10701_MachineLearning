Think of the ending of the Grudge 2 with the following   - a man who repeatedly says the word Sunshine - a cowboy - a love story - Sarah Michelle Gellar cutting herself - and a creepy mirror OH AND UNDERWATER SEA ANIMALS   yay    not a good movie    I seriously did not enjoy it whatsoever  The poster for the movie is extremely misleading as well and I found that it was just to suck people into watching it   I can't believe i went   Save your time and money   go watch Saw III   a film where the writing makes you feel like there was effort put into it    Im Mike and Im out
