This movie wastes virtually every actor's talents in what could best be charitably called a  potboiler   Despite it's action-packed 'Top Gun' opening it is all downhill from there with plenty of stereotypes and unlikely situations following each other until you try to choke yourself on your popcorn  There are so many dead-end story lines in this movie I was guessing at one point it was made by splicing together a discarded TV series  Quinn's Mexican drug-lord role is laughable and his 'associates' plucked right out of a 1970's Quinn-Martin cop show  Costner's character is wooden and gives us no reason to believe he actually fell in love with Mendez' wife  Nor are we convincingly led to believe the wife is aching for companionship and will jump the first hot body coming along  Definitely a 'B' movie at best and a huge waste of time for everyone involved
