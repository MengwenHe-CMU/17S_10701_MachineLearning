You can't really go far when the initial story isn't all that great  The premise of cyborg's needing blood is just dopey  The script is blas  '  The actors don't have much to work with  The sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs  It's a trademark that if the background is the desert  then the movie has no budget  Lack of budget is okay  if there's a story   Solarbabies  and  Blood of Champions  are examples of decent work from no    but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich  Again  forgivable if only the story didn't just plain suck  Finally  this movie commits the biggest crime of all  It doesn't finish  It simply ends as if it's a commercial break away from the rest of the movie  But the rest never comes  Just odd  Just bad
