Hearing about how hilarious this movie is  I finally rent it at the video store and for 75 minutes maybe I laughed 3 times  This movie  a collection of skits that make fun of television is an incoherrent mess  The jokes fall flat  the humor deals with issues from the 1970's that just aren't relevant anymore  and the jokes go on way too long  almost like the new SNL skits the past few years   Yeah  Chevy Chase is in this but maybe of all about 1 or 2 minutes  I liked the fact that this was very raunchy and had nudity galore but couldn't it be funny  Do yourself a favor and rent Kentucky Fried Movie which is a far superior film made in the
