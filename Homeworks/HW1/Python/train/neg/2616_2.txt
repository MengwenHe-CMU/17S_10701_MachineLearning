Remember the name Kevin Lime - and please  please never let him direct again  Timing  pacing  editing  all hopelessly wrong  Three or four decent professionals  next time  guys  walk off the set  can do nothing to save this film from amateurs like Alice Evans  and the kind of production standards you'd expect from teen-produced children's shows on british TV  Greatest mystery  the music  A score so inept  inappropriate and ill-matched to the tone of the film that one seriously wonders if it is a case of sabotage  Add an acoustic that booms apparently unengineered from a single mike  and a director who only intermittently remembers to add auditory action offscreen  and we have what must be on of the greatest ratio of money to result of recent years
