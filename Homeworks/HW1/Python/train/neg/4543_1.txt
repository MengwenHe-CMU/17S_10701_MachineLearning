I read the book and the book was fascinating  This movie  it's direction  the screenplay  and the acting were totally insufferable  I cringed at the lack of a screenplay that could not follow the novel  a novel that has all the action  simplicity  and courage to illustrate a temerity of a great possibly fact based story  I can see why this movie was not released to the general public in most cities  Would not ever recommend this film to anyone I know   Simply  one of he worst adaptations I have seen transformed into a plot less exploration of heaven on earth  The cinematography was indeed the only highlight  But  how could that fail when filmed in an beautiful country such as Peru   To prospective viewers  do not waste your time or energy on this flop
