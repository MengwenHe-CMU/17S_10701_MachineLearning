I thought the film was good in parts the start was exciting  the first 30 minutes of the film were good the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely  i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films  the dialoques did not make sense and i don't think they were very witty  i felt as if they were trying to copy films like phonebooth in terms of dialogues but failed miserably it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story  the entire film features only law and caine  i don't think it was a waste of time its an OK film but not gr8
