The movie opens upon Julian Sands  lying on his back  a black kitten drooling blood into his awaiting mouth from where he holds it  about two feet above him  That was so provocative  and I thought   Here we go  A good vampire movie    And then it died  That was literally the only scene which captured any part of the imagination  It was slow  uneventful drivel thereafter  I was vastly disappointed  as my previous experience with Sands' acting was quite enjoyable  However  this attempt was obviously misdirected and the screenplay left a lot to be desired  Even Julian Sands's questionable performance could not begin to save this already sunken barge of a movie  It rates a 1 1 10 from    the Fiend
