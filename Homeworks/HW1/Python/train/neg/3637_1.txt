I am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film  Often with foreign films I skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming  absence of action  as many of the best international films do not live up to the Western Hollywood model of cinematic storytelling  I enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of clich   in the foreign film arena  I enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow  That said  this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time I wasted watching it  No meaningful character development  no engaging story arc  no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen   Synopsis  A bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves  and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the  house-boy  finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her   While the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic  this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario  I was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it  and I wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings   Unless you have an academic interest in the period I strongly suggest steering clear of this one
