I have watched some pretty poor films in the past  but what the hell were they thinking of when they made this movie  Had the production crew turned into zombies when they came up with the idea of making it  because you sure have to be brain dead to find any enjoyment in it  I am a fan of most genres and enjoy  shoot 'em up  games  but merging the daft scenes from the game just made this ridiculous and unwatchable  As most have already said  there was hardly any script and the acting was weak  I won't waste my time describing it  Anyone who rates this film above 4 has to be part of the production company or Sega  or else they have a very warped concept of entertainment  I must say  I was more annoyed with the video shop  who gave this a thumbs up  which led me to rent it  Thank god I had a second film to watch to restore some of my faith in movies  Comic book guy would be right if he said  Worst movie ever
