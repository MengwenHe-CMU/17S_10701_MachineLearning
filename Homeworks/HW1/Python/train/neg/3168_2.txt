I had to shut this off after about 15 execrable moments   I was hoping it might improve  What I saw was badly acted  directed   written  This movie should never even have been released directly to DVD   The lead character who is a bride top be from HELL has an huge Ice sculpture fall on her killing her  She was such a revolting person I was not even sorry for her  She winds up there in a sort of heaven    was still repulsive  I left shortly after  Eve Longoria portrays her   I hope I never see her again  she cant even act She is just plain annoying  Paul Rudd an actor who normally can do no wrong also was in this dud  Jason Biggs   no longer a teen  is also present  I do like comedies BUT not stupid ones about stupid people  Rating     out of 4  30 points  out of 100  IMDb 2  out of 10
