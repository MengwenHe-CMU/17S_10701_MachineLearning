This wasn't what i wanted to see  I bought this on DVD and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment  Heres what i didn't like  1 They were shooting at the father 2 The tribes was really annoying 3 the dinosaurs  mostly looked to faked 4 The bad scientist well he was annoying 5 The picture quality on the DVD was really bad What i DID like   1 The music by Jerry Goldsmith  This music is really great  I have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie  Sadly the sound quality is not good  but its OK for its time  2 The first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe  3 Baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing 4 That funny scene with the tent   5 The children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses
