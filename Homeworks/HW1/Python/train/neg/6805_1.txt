I ve finished seeing the movie 10 minutes ago  WoW i still cant believe what i've watched  This is absolutely the worst movie EVER  If i would list all the flaws in the movie   this review would take me a lot of sentences   very funny flaws  because of being that bad though  You got to be Amazed with the skill of the commandos assigned to rescue the plane  they didn't even know how to move  Ice-t is so bad actor    and the thing i don't understand  is how the production wanted him to be like a hero  but he's a zero   of course the major flaws will be the landing of an 747  needing only 3 or 4 tips from a guy in transmission to land the plane   amazing   as well as the dead bodys that had almost no blood at all   But i strongly recommend of watching this movie  as its very interesting to see how bad can something get
