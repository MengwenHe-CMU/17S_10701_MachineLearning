Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white   not named Topper  Go figure  This travesty does a gross injustice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes  Hopalong Cassidy  The actor who plays him is young versus old  blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands  Will the real Hopalong please stand up  One of the worst movies ever made   believe it or not  by the person who brought us the Grandfather saga
