Well  TiVo recorded this because of Angelina Jolie  It had 2 5 stars  It seemed promising  It went downhill fast  There is much overacting  even from Angelina  She's about 20 and playing a 16 year old  There are three characters that are supposed to be Italian  Everyone else is Italian- American  The native Italian accents were good  I thought  The young male lead is cute  my wife says  Everyone else in this movie is a fat Italian woman  Even the men  I should have known that when Dick Van Patten was cast as a randy doctor  that that was a bad sign  The two couples chasing their kids around are like the four Italian Stooges  My wife would not let go of the remote  Hopefully she was not taking makeup  clothing or decorating tips  It was a sick and twisted combination of hideous and garish  It was hidegarishous  Cutting off my left ventricle was not sufficient to distract from the pain of watching this movie  If this movie shows up on your TV  do yourself a favor and ram your head through the TV screen instead  You'll be glad you did  The only movie I've ever seen that was worse than this was  Hamburger  The Movie   Or maybe  Deadly Friend
