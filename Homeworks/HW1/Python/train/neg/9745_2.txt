This movie is spoofed in an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000  I think MST3K was at its best when they ripped this movie  Terrible acting  bad makeup  poor effects  chick in skimpy  1960's underwear  I give it a 2  The villain is hard to understand due to the makeup  The assistant says things like 'not you' that sound like NACHOO    think sneezing   It's just poor oration  The long eyebrows are hilarious on one of the characters   I still don't know what 'The Projected Man' means in terms of the plot  I missed some of the beginning though   What is up with this 10 line minimum on posting
