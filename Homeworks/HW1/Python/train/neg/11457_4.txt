OK  I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat  so the expectations for this film ran pretty low  Still  after sitting through this crap there's one key thing I can't seem to get out of my head  I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them  The acting is awful  the characters boring and flat  the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult  and the rowing scenes unexciting  uneventful  and inaccurate  Unless you've got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays  or I guess  Rob Lowe  fetish  there's really no reason to see this one
