Well I don't know where to begin  Obviously this was a made for TV movie  so my expectations were low  I was pleasantly surprised by the overall direction of the second hour  but anything before or after that seemed to be a paint by the numbers sort of movie  And talk about bad chemistry between the tow lovebird detectives     I would go more in depth  but this movie doesn't really deserve it  Grade  D   IMDB rating 3 10
