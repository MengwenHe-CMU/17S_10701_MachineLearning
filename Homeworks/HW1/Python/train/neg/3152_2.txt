Poorly structured  badly written  loaded with cliches and flat dialogue  Not a single scene shines  The actors struggle with a painfully dull scenario that manages to completely avoid any surprises  plot twists or conflict  You know from the first ten minutes where it's going  For a movie set in NY  it has almost no feeling for the city  There are a dozen other indie movies that manage to make it seem magical on a small budget  This one seems like it was shot in Toronto  If you cast Natasha Henstridge  why dress her in baggy sweaters  Why make Vartan look boring and drab  Where's the attraction  I felt like I was watching a sub-par Christian movie of the week it was so asexual and moralizing  Steven Feder's big success is that he convinced people to make this bland movie
