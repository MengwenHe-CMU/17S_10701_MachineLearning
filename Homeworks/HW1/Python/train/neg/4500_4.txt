This movie isn't terrible  really  Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans snicker at  But there are those  and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos  who do not care for Frenchmen  and the Xavier character isn't going to sway them  Let's consider his stereotypical Frenchman attributes  1   Cynical - very cynical  Check  2   Reedy  underfed appearance  check  despite  3   A great appreciation of cuisine  Check  4   Lukewarm work ethic  Check   Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker  from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks    5   Beautiful wife  check  Despite that  6   Loose interpretation of the marriage vows  Check  7   Big sexual ego  which says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner  Check  Whether Mo is a hick or not  there's no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than the script dictates so  On the other hand  as other male reviewers have  I did enjoy seeing Karen Allen's cute  petite body  I'll give the movie four stars  two of them are for that
