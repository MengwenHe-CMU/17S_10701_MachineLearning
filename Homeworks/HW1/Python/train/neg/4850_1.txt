Some unrealistic movie spoilers included  From real life experiences  this movie continued to disappoint from the very beginning  I'm currently deployed on my second tour to Iraq as an infantry man  This film has nothing near what would happen in real life occurrences  From the very start to name a few  the bomb cart  the EOD elements rolling out solo with no escorts  the EOD staff sergeant sneaking of VBC  having sleeves rolled the entire time in ACUs  to where i had to call it quits on my 2 dollar haji copy  the sniper scene  The list would continue  however  it is unnecessary to list things wrong happening with a time span of 2 minutes before more things were incorrect  and the point was made  This movie is for people and critics to watch that have no understanding or experience with deployments or the military  People with military background or knowledge of the military will be disappointed with the inaccuracy
