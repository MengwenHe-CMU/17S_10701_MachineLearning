The title should have been  The walker   That was only he did walk  There was nothing on the movie that was good  The description of the movie doesn't really comply with the plot  The only thing that I can get from the movie is that he was a good son  but a low life terrible person  I'm sorry that I expend my money and time  on this movie  I saw people leaving the theater in the middle of the movie  I stayed hoping that it will better    what a mistake  I got worse  If there is a suggestion that I can make to he producer is to re-direct his life to another field  because making movies is definitely no his cup of tea
