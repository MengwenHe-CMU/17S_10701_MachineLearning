by Dane Youssef A gang of crooks  The perfect plan  It all goes wrong  They're in trouble  The police are outside  They're cornered  What are they gonna do now  Sound familiar  The movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop  the  indie  film and the theater  It's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting    acting angry  tense  scared  conversing  scheming  planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up  A trio of crooks  one leader  one goon  one brother  come up with a big heist scheme    and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works  To top things off  there's a bit of a  fender-bender  and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield  The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically  and leadenly   Dino's Last Chance   Spacey  as a director  tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge  He pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart  And he keeps all the violence off-screen  really  I think that was a mistake  Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge  The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role  Matt Dillon   Drugstore Cowboy  and  Wild Things   seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang  Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs  but he isn't given anything to really do here  William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood  And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this  Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going  The characters are mostly chatting away  trying to think of a plan    and they're to calm and too articulate  There's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside  ready to strike  At one point  one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar  Oh brother  Oh bother  These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up  Shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared  a little uneasy  Meanwhile  all the real action is happening inside  Someone whips out a gun  a baseball bat  which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's    well  kinda sad  But    Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach  improving on her New Orleans accent  Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part  A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look  And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield   The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it's as profane  but never as realistic or as insightful  The movie feels like too much of what it really is    a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's  not bad  but needs a few more re-writes   Spacey shows he's not a terrible director  but he lacks a sort of feel for  shaping a movie  and it feels like he's just filming actors act  These actors are all talented and could work with the material  but they all feel out of place  As I said before  the movie really suffers from miscasting   I don't mean that the wrong actors were cast  I think they found just the right cast  but placed them in all the wrong roles  I think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely  Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack  Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops  keeping Fischter in his  bloodthirsty goon  part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb  That would have been a big improvement  When some actors direct  it works  They can even win Oscars for it  But a lot of the time  when actors direct  they have a tendency to just focus on the performances  Just shoot the actors acting  Sometimes it works    but they need a good showcase for it  An excuse for it  Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well  There are a few really great entries into this genre ' Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations   The Negotiator   This certainly won't become a cult classic  let alone one of AFI's 100  Still  it does have a few nice moments and personal touches  but in the end  it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV  It's just not worth going out of your way to see  I give a 3 out of 10   Spacey's other directorial credit   Beyond The Sea  was reportedly a better effort  Hmmm    maybe it's true  You need to fail before you succeed  by Dane Youssef
