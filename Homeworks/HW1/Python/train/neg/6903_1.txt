Probably New Zealands worst Movie ever made The Jokes They are not funny  Used from other movies   just plain corny The acting Is bad even though there is a great cast The story is Uninteresting   Boring Has more cheese then pizza huts cheese lovers pizza kind of like the acting Has been do 1 000 times before I watched this when it came on TV but was so boring could only stand 30 minutes of it   This movie sucks Do not watch it   Watch paint dry instead
