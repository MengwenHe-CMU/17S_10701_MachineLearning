This film is a huge steaming pile   I have no idea why anyone felt that the Garland Mason version needed to be redone  nor why Striesand would have been a first choice to star  For that matter  I have no idea why our people  Gay Americans  tend largely to regard Striesand as some kind of treasure  At least in my opinion  she had peaked professionally with with Funny Girl  and Bogdanovich's What's Up Doc   Do yourself a favor and rent the Judy classic  or even the original  a fine film in its own right   but please  Please  PLEASE skip this stinkpot
