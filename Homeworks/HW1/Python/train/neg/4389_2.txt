If you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy  then look no further  Starting at about the halfway point  the beautiful and erotic Arielle Dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity  That is the only thing that made this movie worth watching  The story is both lame and preposterous  the humor is corny  and character development is basically non-existent
