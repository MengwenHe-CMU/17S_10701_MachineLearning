I'll just be vague about my potential spoiling comments  There are enough canned plot elements in this movie that it's essentially pre-spoiled  This movie derives a few ideas from a Southern classic  To Kill A Mockingbird  I suppose maybe TKOM got its ideas from some source     at any rate  after you watch this  you'll say   Oh yeah  that is a ripoff   I think the truly entertaining thing about these McMovies is once you've identified a plot element  is to figure out whether they'll stick with the original  or try to twist it around  Not a lot of twists in this one
