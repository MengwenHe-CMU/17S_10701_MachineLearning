Slow and nice images changed one another  with sometimes annoying music  you know Bjork  in background  for the first 75  of the movie  If you did not have enough sleep  that's a good time   But  in the last 20  of the movie director decides to bring idea of re-birth  re-incarnation or else  through S M images   spiritual lovers  are cutting each others bodies with knives  For me it was very much disturbing and actually changed general impression of blend of abstract art and images of modern Japanese mystery   Operator and director are great  but weird   Did not enjoy it at all
