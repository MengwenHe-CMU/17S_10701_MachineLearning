Went to see the movie  Troy  this afternoon  Here's what I learned  Contrary to popular opinion and history in general  Greek men were not gay  EVER  This was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter  So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie  Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup  She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which  though numerous  were probably all filmed on the same day  one after the other  with the director saying   Alright  now look beautiful       good     OK  now look frightened     good    now look depressed     good     now look interested       good     now look beautiful again     good     Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents  Those with American accents couldn't act  Trojans looked just like Greeks  but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen  Brad Pitt does not blink on camera  Helen of Troy's biggest line was   They're coming for me   Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music  Brad Pitt's thighs go all the way up  Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close  but it's OK  They were cousins  Never mind what history says  Peter O'Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression  Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names  but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O'Toole in drag  Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting  much like American men  All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color    Light Egyptian  by Max Factor  Troy had only three women  There were lots of blond Greeks  which is good news for Brad Pitt  who would otherwise have really stuck out  Despite their coastal desert locale  Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires  funeral pyres  Trojan horses and the like  British actors look silly with Greek hairdos  Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes  Greek soldiers fought constantly  but their outfits always looked impeccable  Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts  Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins  even back when they were all new
