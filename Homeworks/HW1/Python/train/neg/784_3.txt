Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals  this movie is not for everyone  The story is very similar to other movies  in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age  and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family  She does that by choosing some kind of sport  and with the help of a local boy  that for some reason falls in love with her  she confronts her problems and wins  In Girlfight it's boxing  in Bend it like Beckham it's soccer  and now it's Kung Fu  But Fighter is much inferior product than these two  it was simply embarrassing to watch it  Semra Turan  the  actress  that playing the role of a teenage girl  maybe can do a lot of things  but one thing she can't do is to act  Her presence on the screen is anemic and clumsy  the dramatic situations  in which she tries to show some emotions  are dreadful  her body and facial language are of amateur actress  badly instructed by the director  The rest of the cast is a little better  but they just cannot save this clich   movie with stereotypical characters and shallow plot  Besides a few relatively good moments this movie has nothing new or interesting to offer  Even the kung fu fighting is not a reason to watch this  it's just so boring  The slow motion was really unnecessary  the choreography was basic and lacked the inspiration  and most of the kung fu scenes are just training or standing in all kind of kung fu positions  not actually fighting  Not to mention how ridiculous it looks when a small and skinny girl fights big and muscular boys  and knocks them off their feet   The only reason this movie has been noticed at all is because it's European  It's very easy to publicize this movie - A first martial arts film from Denmark  but don't be fooled  it's not  It's just a drama about stupid teenage girl and her problems  which are  by the way  not really convincing  Bad movie with embarrassing lines  acting and story
