This film was probably inspired by Godard's Masculin  f  minin and I urge you to see that film instead  The film has two strong elements and those are   1  the realistic acting  2  the impressive  undeservedly good  photo  Apart from that  what strikes me most is the endless stream of silliness  Lena Nyman has to be most annoying actress in the world  She acts so stupid and with all the nudity in this film    it's unattractive  Comparing to Godard's film  intellectuality has been replaced with stupidity  Without going too far on this subject  I would say that follows from the difference in ideals between the French and the Swedish society  A movie of its time  and place  2 10
