I think I've seen all of the Grisham movies now and generally they're all very poor  except for The Rainmaker  but this one is so bad it's unbelievable WARNING SPOILERISH It's one of those movies where the character does the stupid irrational things that no one would ever do  He's a lawyer for Christ's sake  Why when his children go missing does he not call the Police  Oh yes it's because all the Police hate lawyers so they're just ignore him and let him be attacked  When he's arrested for murder they just let him go free  he would be locked up in a cell pending a bail hearing   Why would you drag your kids halfway across the country when you could easily protect them at home  The Police don't bother to try and find an escaped mental patient  they don't bother to interview his daughter  As for the ridiculous ending    In summary  silly  very unrealistic and a complete waste of time  0 10    One of the worst films ever made
