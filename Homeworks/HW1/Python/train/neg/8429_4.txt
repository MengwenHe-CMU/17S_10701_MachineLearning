This movie fails to offer anything new to a genre that has traditionally shown the cross cultural love story underpinned by the politics mid 20th century   pre-WWII India  where the British and their modern ways are bad and the primitive but honest and true Indians are good  Surely such clich  d depictions of the British are rather pass   now  Apart from the drama that fuels the second part of the movie the narrative is predictable  the acting is pedestrian and two-dimensional  and the directing obvious and unimaginative  The story really needed to be fleshed out and would certainly have benefited from another half an hour of screen time to give the characters and narrative more depth and give the viewer something to feel some investment in  All in all  rather uninspiring  Oh and Linus Roache just cannot do tragedy - going cross-eyed with emotional pain just doesn't work for me
