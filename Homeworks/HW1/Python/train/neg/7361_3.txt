Mr Perlman gives a standout performance  as usual   Sadly  he has to struggle with an underwritten script and some nonsensical set pieces  Larsen is in  Die Hard  mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles  I'm sure he could do better but seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part  The lovely Erika is very decorative  even though fully clothed   and shows some signs of  getting  acting at last  SFX are mainly poor CGI and steals from other movies  The shootouts are pitiful - worthy of the A-Team Not even worth seeing for Perlman - AVOID
