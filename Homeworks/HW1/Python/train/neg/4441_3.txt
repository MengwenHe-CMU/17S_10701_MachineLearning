 Triumph of Love  is proof that not every Com  die-Fran  aise author who uses cross-dressing disguised courtship like Shakespeare is worth seeing   Or maybe something was lost in the translation of this adaptation of Marivaux  a Commedia Dell Arte-inspired playwright of whom Brittannica says   His nuanced feeling and clever wordplay became known as marivaudage    While Mira Sorvino has fun dangling three mixed-up romances  her pants role wasn't even up to Cherubino in  Marriage of Figaro   The herky-jerky editing is annoying and just seems to indicate that a lot of takes were needed for each long speech  Best was Fiona Shaw as the fooled spinster  as well as the costumes  The glimpses of audience we see and the closing curtain call to wink that this is all artifice doesn't really help   originally written 5 29 2002
