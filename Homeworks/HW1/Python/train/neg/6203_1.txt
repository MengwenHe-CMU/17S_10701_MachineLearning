I saw this at the Edinburgh Film Festival  It was awful  Every clich  d  violent  rich boy fantasy was on display  you just knew how it was going to end especially with all the shots of the chef's wife and the rape of the first girl  The worst part was the Q A with the director writer and writer producer they tried to come across as intellectuals but you could tell they're the types that get off on violence  I bet anything they frequent brothels and do drugs  Don't waste your time  I had to keep my boyfriend from walking out of it
