I love the depiction of the 30s and 40s in film  I love Salma Hayek  I was more than ready to love this picture  but       BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO             No sir  nothing good about this  The only entertaining aspect for me was Colin Farrell's character is an insecure writer and this screenplay  despite tackling the juicy subject of racism  approaches the audience in the fashion of an ABC Afterschool Special  The only person who didn't sound like he was  acting' was Sutherland  and his minutes were few  Stale approach to a tired plot
