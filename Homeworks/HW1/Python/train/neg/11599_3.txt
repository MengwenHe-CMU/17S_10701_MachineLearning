The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches    Moderate Spoiler Alert  Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone  The Movie  which delivers death by cartoon  Still this was handled nicely  especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out  Additionally  there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle  Having said that  I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale  because this was pretty awful  I bought  Soul Survivors  at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream  However   where  Soul Survivors  has nothing to redeem it  or have it make any sense  this at least had a couple of stylish notes  referred to above  Interestingly  the DVD lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens  which is the only way to watch this  The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable  3 out of 10
