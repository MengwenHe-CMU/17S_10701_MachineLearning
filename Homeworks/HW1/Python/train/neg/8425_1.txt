Truly a disgusting  vile film  with only a small amount of real humour  The character of the father in particular is vulgar in the extreme  intentionally so  obviously   and portrayed in the most pathetic  seedy manner  My wife and I found this film horribly upsetting  with absolutely no redeeming features at all  Frankly  I wish I had never seen it  I consider this British effort to be a sick and gross embarrassment  Those who enjoyed this film have an ability I totally lack  that of rejoicing in a display of deep depravity and squalor  The producers should be ashamed of themselves
