My Favorite part was when the credits started to roll  I wish I could give it a  0000000000001 out of 10  I really wish I had that Hour and thirty minutes back  Don't waste your money or time on it  I really could have watched grass grow and felt better after wards  Nadia was really pretty and I hope the movie didn't destroy her career  But she chose to be in it  All in all it sucked more than any other movie has sucked  More than Kazaam and Glitter combined  That's saying something  Don't Do it
