When my wife and I decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn't fail  I love Billy Crystal  my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it  We were misled  in spades  On my part  I felt Billy Crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film  Sure  he cracked a couple of good jokes  but as a character he did nothing but take up space  And poor Julia Roberts  In past shows she plays well as a strong-willed  self-determined lady  In this flick  she seems completely repressed and had very little fire  This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watching  OK  if I were to find one good thing  it would have to be Christopher Walken  Now that's entertainment  But  just like Billy Crystal  hardly anything is shown of his character  If you're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value  go see it  But if you're looking for a smart  romantic comedy  this is not your film  It's none of the above
