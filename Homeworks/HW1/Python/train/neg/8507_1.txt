I agree with the previous comment  what a disappointment  Rented it thinking it was going to be a good movie since Mira and Olivier where in it  I was surprised by their performance  expected more since they're good actors  Thought it was a slow beginning but it got worse  I even laughed at some bad stunts   when is supposed to be a mystery movie  You can even guess who is the killer beforehand     For real what happened    Sorry to say but don't even bother you'll waste time and money  Boring
