I only rented this because i loved the first movie  However  calling it John Carpenters Vampires  Los Muertos is just a con trick to get you to rent it  He is in fact executive producer and clearly had nothing to do with the making of this film  Jeepers Creepers Anyone   A tragic storyline  terrible special effects and Jon Bon Jovi as the least convincing Vampire Hunter of all time  It's not even comically bad  What we end up with is a dull  uninvolving film with a terrible script and indefinsibly bad and clich  d acting  It just reeks of low budget  Avoid like the Bubonic plague
