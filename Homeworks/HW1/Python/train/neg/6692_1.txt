During a sleepless night  I was switching through the channels   found this embarrassment of a movie  What were they thinking  If this is life after  Remote Control  for Kari  Wuhrer  Salin  no wonder she's gone nowhere  And why did David Keith take this role  It's pathetic  Anyway  I turned on the movie near the end  so I didn't get much of the plot  But this must've been the best part  This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl   this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the cheap porn movies  She calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father  Oh  I didn't expect tongue   Great lines  After this  I had to see how it ended   Well  of course  this bitch from hell has a helluva past  so the SWAT team is upstairs  And yes   they surround her  And YES YES  The kid blows her brains out     AHAHHAHAHAHA   This is must-see TV
