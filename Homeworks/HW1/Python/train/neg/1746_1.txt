Probably the worst Bollywood film I've seen  No plot line  Very little character developments  Full of silly and pointless humor  The whole film was chaotic and direction-less  There was no proper ending to the story  The airport was filmed in a shopping mall   Same story chewed over and over again until you want to say  please  just move on with it    Even the song and dance was pointless and badly choreographed  The only good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around    but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days  Btw I'm not from an Indian background 2 10
