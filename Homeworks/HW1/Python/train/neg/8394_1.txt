Ostensibly this is a Z-grade DTV horror film  But with lines like    It's easy to die  I have  many times  and  Why are you reading that book     Because it makes the plot more interesting  and  You made your way in here  now you can make your way out again     after he leads a man into the basement   and take a listen to what they chant  - it's not that clear what this film  made in the era known for post-structuralism  is actually about  or whether its just bad film-making  The acting is atrocious  but some actors I know  so are they hamming it up   An old house  cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling  is the site of murders  A  bad  film is made in the grounds and the story replays again
