   HERE BE SPOILERS     Recap  Mia  Helin  is returning home from capital Stockholm to rural R  ttvik to celebrate her fathers 70th birthday  She is by far the youngest child  and has two sisters Eivor  Ernst  and Gunilla  Petr  n   Eivor has a family and still lives in R  ttvik and Gunilla has divorced and moved a town away  Mia is still single and is focused on her career  There are a lot of jealousy and almost animosity between the sisters and conflicts arise all around as they confront each other and each have personal problems they have difficult to handle  As the party goes on  and alcohol consumed   more and more secrets become unveiled and more and more conflicts arise    Comments  To be the work of a new writer director it was disappointing to see this movie to follow in the exact same tracks that older Swedish comedy dramas has been following for years  There are really no new elements or ideas  This movie draws upon three basic areas  1  Embarrassing humor only based on characters making a fool of themselves  2  Sorrow and 3  Anxiety  This move has the focus on the last one  almost forgetting the first point as the movie goes along  No loss though  since the humor that is there is not funny  The performances from the cast are good I guess  though it is lost behind all the anguish and soon forgotten  I had hopes that there would be new ideas and influences  but there were none  To conclude  there are better ways to spend one's time than watching this  3 10
