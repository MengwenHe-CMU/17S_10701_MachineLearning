Hi folks Forget about that movie  John C  should be ashamed that he appears as executive producer in the credits  bon jovi has never been and will never be an actor and the FX are a joke  The first vampires was good     and it was the only vampires  This thing here just wears the same name  Just a waste of time thinks     JAKE Scorpio
