I consider myself to be a bit of a snob when it comes to everything and although the cinematic experience is more suited to explosions than high drama  I can be very stuck up about films  too  Not all art films  however  are better than King Kong  I quite possibly would give Kong two stars  double this film's haul  My guess is that people got so excited about this because it was almost identical in style to what you can see in a play  For the less discerning art-buff  a film that looks like a play is 'great art'  This film  however  was useless  There was hardly any story so it relied on high drama  The only drama in this film was whether the cat would drop off the roof or not  So  deep and meaningful dialogue  then  No  Great acting  Hardly  To be excessively fair  Some of the scenery was interesting  though  Communist flats  city vistas  Petersburg   and the Soviet trams still in service
