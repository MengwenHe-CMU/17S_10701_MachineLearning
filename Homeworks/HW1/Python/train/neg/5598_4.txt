Saw it at the Philadelphia Gay and Lesbian Film Fest  What can I say  Against my better judgment  I liked it  but it seemed to me that that acting was a little   weak  mostly I noticed this from the family of the teen boy   I mean  the script wasn't stellar to begin with  but the actors didn't make me believe the relationships  The plot is also predictable  Nonethelss  I liked it  The characters are likable  and the plot is not challenging or upsetting  It's sweet  the characters care about each other  and I don't count it as fifty minutes ill-spent   But I don't recommend it
