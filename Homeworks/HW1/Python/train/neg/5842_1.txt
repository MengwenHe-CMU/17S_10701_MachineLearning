What a terrible film  It starts well  with the title sequence  but that's about as good as it gets  The movie is something about rats turning into monsters and going on a killing spree  The acting isn't so much poor  but the script is pointless and the film isn't even scary despite the atmospheric music  It really is amazing that some group cobbled together this bag of rubbish and thought it would make a good film  It isn't a good film  It's trash  and I urge you not to waste a minute of your life on it  One out of ten
