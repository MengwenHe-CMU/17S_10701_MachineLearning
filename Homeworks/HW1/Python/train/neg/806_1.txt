This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with ketchup  and the overall aftertaste is just as disgusting   Will be used in the 9th circle of Hell at recreation time  Just plain torture  I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than watch this appalling drivel again - ever  Horrible  Horrible  Horrible  You know  the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese  here it's ONLY holes - and the excitement factor  Well that turns watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport  My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK'd this drivel  did they think about the premise   I sincerely hope not  otherwise there is no redemption  the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes  Made for TV should not be a synonym for   Sure  let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms  Our audience are idiots   I was hooked just to know how it could get any worse  This is not a good sign  folks   Hallmark should be ashamed for releasing it  I should be ashamed for watching it  I am ashamed  I'm off for a long shower
