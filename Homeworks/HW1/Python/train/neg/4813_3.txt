I've given up trying to figure out what version of this I'm watching  The copyright at the end indicates 1983  And though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film  I will say that watching a film obviously made in the Aquarian Age  including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons  but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling  Extremely unsettling  My main objection here is HOW DARE THE FILMMAKERS BURY CUTE-AS-A-BUTTON PAMELA FRANKLIN ALIVE  HOW DARE THEY  Seriously she's all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies I've seen her in - this crapfest and the otherwise excellent Legend of Hell House - they kill her off  I would like to put the film industry on notice  Pamela Franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off I SHALL ASK HIM TO STEP OUTSIDE  NO ONE BEATS UP ON PAMELA FRANKLIN AND GETS AWAY WITH IT  I AM QUITE CROSS  THE FURY HAS BEEN UNLEASHED  For B-movie fans seeking out a crapfest  you could do much worse than this  On the plus side  this is not a film which involves Satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way - this movie is a hardcore satanic film  Wall-to-wall satanic ceremonies  baphomets  hallucinations  a ludicrous rat attack - what else could you ask for  This excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted-on 1980s synth soundtrack  which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be  The soundtrack reminded me of something you'd hear on The Equalizer  It's really bad  Also  they made Pamela Franklin squash her charming English accent  which was also quite rude  if not a cruel atrocity  against the viewer  such as you might find covered by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  I say that we have a right to hear Pamela Franklin speak in her own voice  Who's with me  I could forgive everything else about this film if they didn't abuse Pamela Franklin  And so I throw the gauntlet down  sirs -- ANYONE WHO MESSES WITH PAMELA FRANKLIN MESSES WITH ME  EVEN IN A FICTIONAL CONTEXT  GOOD DAY  SIRS
