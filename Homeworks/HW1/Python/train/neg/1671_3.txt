I saw this in the market place at the Cannes Film Festival   It's a real cheapo prod - nothing wrong with that but you have to make up for it with a bit of sex or gore or both   Think Larry Cohen   Sean Young is an interesting actor - well done to the producers for hooking her I guess  The opening scene in the space-ship coming down is hilarious - you could picture all the crew hands shaking it around   Ha ha - but I wish the people who made this well - at least it's not pretentious
