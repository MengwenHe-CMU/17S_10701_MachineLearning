this film was totally not what i expected   if this film was called something else no one would even notice the difference between the two   its really strange because i cannot see the point   the prequel and sequel lets just say don't make sense  the don't even match   maybe i am naive but ain't a vol 1   vol 2 meant to match up   carlito was in jail in the 1st one and dies in the original  and in the prequel he lives and don't go jail   the plot was OK   but they should have changed round some actors and some of the story line and the name of the film and it would have been a good film   i really expected it to end like the other one started   if some one has a opinion on this post it please
