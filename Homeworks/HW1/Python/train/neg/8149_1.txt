What an absolute pile of pants  Having read Chris Brookmyre's books religiously since I came across  Quite Ugly      I was delighted to find out that this drama had been commissioned  I obviously had too much faith   Nesbitt is probably the best thing in this show - and even he doesn't quite fit  How anyone can read the book  and then adapt it to this piece of dross is beyond me  Entire characters are changed  situations are dropped  and to see Parlablane's dramatic break-in reduced to Nesbitt doing a quick chin up and sliding open a bay window    it brought tears to my eyes  I dread to think what's going to happen with  Country Of The Blind  if this is the benchmark    Please  just avoid it
