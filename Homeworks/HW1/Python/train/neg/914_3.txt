 Review in English  since Swedish is not allowed  I saw this movie with extremely low expectations  and I can sadly inform you that the movie barely lived up to them  As much as I loved to see Janne  Loffe  Karlsson on the big screen again  the writers should have realized early in the scriptwriting process that seven people falling into the water  isn't original or funny  The story is very thin and the jokes are used and predictable  the ones that ain't  is just plain boring  I smiled like three times during the entire film  The placement of Swedish Findus products is  unintentionally  funny  why not just a big sign saying   Findus made it happen    G  ta Kanal 2 doesn't need to be seen at the cinema or on DVD  just wait for it to air on TV  it wont take too long
