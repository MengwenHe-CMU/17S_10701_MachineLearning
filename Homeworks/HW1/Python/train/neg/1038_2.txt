Raising victor Vargas is just a bad film  No amount of denial or ad-dollar supported publicity with change this sad fact  Maybe Peter Sollett saw he didn't have the money to do the movie he wanted to make and decided to take the easy way out by making a bad film that cynically apes the tenets of current  edgy film-making   Maybe he just doesn't know any better  It's hard to tell  What's not hard to tell is the result  Except for a few viewers who will intellectualize the bad film-making into an attempt at pseudo-realism  few will enjoy it  I know I didn't  Do yourselves a favor and pass on this film
