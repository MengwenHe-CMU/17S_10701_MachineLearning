Great cast  Great acting  Unpredictable story line for the first half hour or so  I was really wanting to know what was going to happen to each of these unredeeming characters  and how their seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined  But when the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players  they mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill for the last two hours  I kept thinking it would get better  but it only got worse  Don't believe the reviews  This is a waste of time   Think about it -- Tom Cruise made ugly -- why  The gorgeous hunky bartender wearing braces -- why  I know it had to do with the plot  but without them  at least there would have been one attractive cast member to remember
