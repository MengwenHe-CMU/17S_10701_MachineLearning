the more i think about it  there was nothing redeeming about this movie  i saw it 9 months ago  so my memory might have made it worse than it was  but i do know it was at least as bad as a 4 out of 10   after seeing the movie  i met the director  he seemed so clueless as to what he was doing or what he had done  and as far as i could tell  he didn't care for the film either  even he agreed that he didn't really know what he was doing  and he was forced to do certain things because it was filmed digitally   i felt that the movie was trying to hard to fit in to the formula that it built for itself   9 people all have to be connected in some way  how can we get from point 'A' to point 'B'  so in order get from the prostitute we see in the start and back to her at the end they 10 minutes on each character's relationship to another person  it makes one feel choked by the 2 demensional  badly drawn characters  I just remembered the one redeeming part of the movie    Steve Bouchemi there is one scene where he is amazing  that's it  as i say    4 out of 10
