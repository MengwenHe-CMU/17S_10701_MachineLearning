I won't add to the plot reviews  it's not very good  Very improbable orphanage on Bala  Cushing and Lee at their height  Some nice scenery  Good for face spotting  and I quote   look at the mouth  that is Cassie from Fools and Horses   Otherwise  a poor example of the British film industry  Fulton MacKay was far better in Fraggle Rock  Keith Barron was better in anything else and Diana Dors did what she did best  Redeeming feature  It was free to watch on the Horror channel prior to its going over to subscription  I won't be subscribing on this effort
