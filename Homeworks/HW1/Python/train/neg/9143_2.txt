as an actor I really like independent films but this one is amateur at best  The boys go to Vermont for a civil service yet when the plane lands it flies over a palm tree - were the directors aware that palm trees are not in Vermont  Pines yes - palms no  And the same for the wedding service - again nice grove of palm trees  When the boys are leaving VT they apparently could not get a ticket on any major airline since the plane that is filmed is Federal Express  Did they ship themselves Overnight in a crate  Come on guys little details like this separate an indi film from totally amateur  The Christian brother is far gayer than Arthur with his bleached hair and tribal band tattoo  The two should have switched roles  The minor characters are laughable and overact something terrible  Applause to the directors for making a gay film but pay some attention to your locations and casting next time
