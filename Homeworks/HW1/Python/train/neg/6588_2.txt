The following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie  1  Clich  s abound  Seriously  awful  twists  are everywhere  2  The narrative jumps around in time  which would be fine if done well  but it's not  3  Lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static  or drastically change for no good reason  4  Big one  HORRIBLE ACTING  Over the top from nearly every person  The following are some of the best points from the movie  1  The lead is damn good looking  As I see it  there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie  a  People who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive  b  People who often think to themselves   I like Hollywood dreck rife with clich  s and overacting  but if only I could watch it in Korean     There's a lot of good Korean cinema out there  so why waste your time with garbage
