The story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring  Some of the audience seemed to find it funny but I like more intelligent humor  There were several known Swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script  Lena Endre was good looking as always  I don't remember the original movie so I can't say if it's better or worse  If you enjoy movies like S  llskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at
