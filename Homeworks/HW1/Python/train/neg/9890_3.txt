Another rape of History This movie is a catastrophe  it just uses a historic story and makes a sweet love story  with bad acting and low budget production  The movie should be 1 3 the time  they just dragged the time to make a mini series  The battle scenes are so stupid and illogical  the solders log stupid  the costumes a catastrophe  The Romans were good in fighting in opened areas  one of their armies was completely destroyed by the Germans when they tried to fight in a forest  in this movie the Romans choose to fight in side the city  I mean get real  And by the way Cleopatra was from a Macedonian origin  which means a light skinned person
