Despite much style  flash  and glitter  this French musical fails to speak  The tunes are repetitive  predictable  and tedious  The story is uninteresting  as are the many characters   People break into song and dance  without motivation or reason  Most of the cast wears phony looking wigs and hairpieces  and the sets look hopelessly studio bound  To be honest  this video of the restored version was stopped before the end  so negative an effect it had on me  Certainly a shame  to have such a multi-talented cast in so feeble a final effort   Goes to show  I guess  where followups  in this case  to the great classic   Umbrellas   often do go awry  One cannot recapture  only recreate
