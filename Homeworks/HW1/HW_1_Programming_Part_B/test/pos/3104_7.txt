I have this movie on a collection of inexpensive B-movies  It's not restored  in fact  the audio was difficult to discern for the first few minutes  At first  it seemed like a typical haunted house film  and feels very much like the forerunner of Clue  Murder by Death  House on Haunted Hill  etc  About a half hour into the film  the storyline takes a really interesting twist--and it goes from being a clich   melodrama to something entirely different  and far more entertaining than I had initially thought  Check it out  it's a great deal of fun  even if the long clips and wider shots  and near lack of music score  make it feel a bit creaky by today's standards
