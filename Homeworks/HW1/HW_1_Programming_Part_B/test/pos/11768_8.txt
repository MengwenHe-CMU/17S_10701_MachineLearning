A fun romp   a lot of good twists and turns   and we were not even baked   Didn't know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD    oddly it was there along with The City of Lost Children  and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen  The plot keeps you wondering throughout  The acting was awesome   Hank Azaria shows his talent again  Bill Bob is Billy Bob    wecis   Definitely worth watching
