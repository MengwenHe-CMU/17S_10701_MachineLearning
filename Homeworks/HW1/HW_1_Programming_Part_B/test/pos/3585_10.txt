I think that this short TV series  was absolutely wonderful  and gave both a in-depth and clear explanation of everything that was on the screen at the given time  This was by far David Attenborough at his best  I personally thought this was one of the best documentaries in the past decade  This is definitely worth peoples money  I also found the bit about the abyss and deep water the most fascinating and interesting part  It was incredible to find out that the 'Blue planet' team discovered more than 10 new species of underwater life   In this documentary Attemborough almost certainly lived up to his high reputation   This was a masterpiece and will always be considered to be one of the best modern documentaries  Many congratulation's to the 'Blue planet' team
