After watching Tipping the Velvet by Sarah waters i decided to watch Fingersmith  the characters were just as good in both performances  though missing Rachael Stirling in the adaptation of Fingersmith  The story line overall was of a good choice  the twisting and the unravelling of the characters were amazing  Excellent watch only missing Rachael Stirling  If you do enjoy the romance of two girls this isn't one of the best films to watch   It takes on a different spin from Tipping The Velvet but just as good   Would recommend it to everyone
