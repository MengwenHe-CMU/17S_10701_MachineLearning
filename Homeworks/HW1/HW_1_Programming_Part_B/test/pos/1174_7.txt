This is the kind of movie that people of a certain age will say of  I didn't think they made movies like that anymore   Walter Matthau gives his usual over-the-top performance  but instead of leaving teeth marks all over the scenery  leaves endearing grease stains  He is like that great uncle we all know that still wears plaid polyester and embarrasses everyone  but we still love anyway  Jack Lemmon's performance reminds us why he had more Golden Globe nominations than anyone else  22   He gives a true-to-life performance of the basically 'good  ordinary man'  even in the milieu of a farce  This film will probably not appeal to people who prefer blunt humor designed to confront or offend  but will appeal to people who appreciate broad farce played with a straight face  The entire supporting cast is excellent in their ability to play such absurd characters while maintaining the reality of each character  Brent Spiner gives a marvelous performance as a professional version of a lounge lizard  Anyone who has known professional hosts in real life will immediately recognize the type he is playing  He nails the type perfectly  His rendition of 'slime' merits study as a perfect example of the contrast between absurd and pathetic  The plot is rather a straight-forward 'let's marry rich' theme that has the usual results  Just because a plot theme has been done a thousand times does not mean that it is dated  but rather that it is a timeless theme  The rest of the supporting cast shows what can happen when professionals exhibit their skills in the roles that are written for them  instead of vying for the spotlight  In this film even the second tier actors shine  It is also obvious that they enjoyed making this film  The plot may be standard and thin  but it allows the performers to shine  This film is a true treat for people who want to see professional actors engaging in their craft  The plot falls away and the performers shine
