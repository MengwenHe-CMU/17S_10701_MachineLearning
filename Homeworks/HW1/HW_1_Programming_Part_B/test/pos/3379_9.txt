GREAT  Chris Diamantopoulos has got to be the best Robim Williams that I have every seen   He acts it up  perfectly  This was like watching Robim Williams as he really was and is   It almost made me cry watching him  I had no idea that Robin was as close a friend to John Belushi as he was  The portrayal of this relationship was very good and could almost stand on it's own merits   Very sad  what both of them went through  I really felt for both Val and Robin during his rough times  I am glad that they ended it in a high note  I hope Robin puts a  100 bill in this guy's hat    And it was great that it was filmed in Vancouver
