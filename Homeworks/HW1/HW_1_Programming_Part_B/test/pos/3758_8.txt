What a surprise  A basic copycat of the comedy classic 'The Nutty Professor' only naughtier  Funny guy Tim Thomerson  who steals the show as Blinkin in Robin Hood-Men In Tights  is downright hilarious as the anal retentive Dr  Jekyll and the sex crazed Hyde   The one scene that is really funny is when Dr  Lanyon  Mark Blankfield  catches Jekyll in bed with his daughter and says    how dare you take advantage of my innocent daughter    Jekyll replies   but sir  I'm going ahead with the operation   Lanyon replies back   oh  Well in that case fu   your brains out
