I don't understand where these bad comments are coming from  The movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night  The part that gets you is that this could all happen  Not to the extent perceived in the movie  but the whole idea is reality  This movie took that reality and twisted it into a Dee Snider nightmare  Three thumbs up  the third one is from the dead body in my freezer
