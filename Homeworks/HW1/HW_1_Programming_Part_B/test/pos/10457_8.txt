Feels like an impressionistic film  if there is such a thing  The story is well told  very poetic  the characters well developed and well acted by the interpreters  or interpreted by the actors      The film delights in its own sumptuous emotions at times and works well  unless you hate such emotion in movies - not so in my case  It's a very humanistic film  The landscape and even the extraordinary situation of the displaced cook are very poetic in their own right  Well done  A good classic for any good film collection
