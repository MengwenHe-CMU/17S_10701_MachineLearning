planktonrules comments must've been written on Topsy-Turvy Day  because everything stated by that simple life form is the opposite of real truth  'Bluebeard's Eighth Wife' is hilarious in every scene  in every way -- the chemistry between Colbert and Cooper could not have been finer   supporting cast is superb  Writing and direction are magnificent    Like so many other comments on this board again I lament   Why can't films be like this anymore    This is classic Paramount 1930's screwball comedy at its best  folks
