I can't even begin to imagine why everyone hates this movie so much  It had me literally crying with laughter several times   I trust you slept well    actually  we had a bit of a rough night    ah  the perils of adultery     admittedly  the ending is a little flat  but still has its moments  the booger ball's obvious fake spalsh as flew into the ocean   beach house paradiso    personally  i think this is the funniest movie i've ever seen  10 10
