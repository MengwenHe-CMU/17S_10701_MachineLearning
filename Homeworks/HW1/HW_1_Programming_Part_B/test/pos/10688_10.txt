I had never seen this movie before it aired on a local cable sci-fi network  It reminded me of the Irwin Allen TV series of the late 60's  Time Tunnel etc   Excellent effects  they beat Star Trek 5 done 20 years later  but then that wasn't very hard to accomplish   I found the script very intriguing and mature for this type of production  They would have needed a few touch ups to tie some loose ends on the characters' level  but for a kid movie its surprisingly interesting  especially the the glimpse at futuristic euro- politics  surprisingly similar to today's European Union   The plot is indeed reminiscent of Twilight Zone in general  as other users have pointed   but in this case it's a compliment  Great sets  by the way  7 10
