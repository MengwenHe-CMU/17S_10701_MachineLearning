I didn't see such a movie where the creators put so much heart's blood into their work and paid attention to the finest details for a very long time  Everything was well thought and perfectly put into reality  Camera-work  editing and compositing worked so good together it was just amazing  The titles were so fun and so perfectly choreographed  This movie just blew me away  The  Showdown  could have been cut down by 10 or 15 minutes though  It's a near to perfect homage to early silent noir Films story  acting  scenery and costumes were perfectly fitting and believable to have com from the times of silent film-making
