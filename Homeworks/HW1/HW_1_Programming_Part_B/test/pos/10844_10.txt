This was one of the most emotional movies I have seen  Passion  Pleasure  Pain  Despair  Sorrow  Healing  Cleansing and Love  The entire movie was spellbinding  Everything was done so well  the adaptation from the book  the actors  the sets  the camera shots  This movie touched me deeply in so many ways  It reminded me of the despair that loosing your love can have  and the time it takes to heal that wound  You may love again  but will always be risking the pain that comes with separation   Is this not one of the most important age-old questions   Is it better to have love and lost   Than to never have loved before    -Ascension
