Over the many years  there are some films that just slip by   hardly anyone views   Choose Conner is one of those films  This small gem played at some festivals   had a short 2 week run in a small theatre in West Hollywood making all of about   5500  It is now on DVD I do hope many more will now see this   It is a strange drama of a shrewd youngish politician  who influences a very bright 15 year old lad This politico also has a handsome nephew  about 17 years old  who befriends the 15 year old lad  The above paragraph is slightly vague as to what occurs  SO is the film    that is what I appreciated  we do NOT get all the facts Much is left to our own thinking  You will hear dialog that makes this logical   Steven Weber  Wings  is our politician his role is slightly vague this is another point for the audience to ponder Alex D Linz is our 15 year old  He was about 17 when they made this movie  but easily can pass for younger  He has been in films   TV since he was a young child  He is a very good actor   is quite convincing  Escher Holloway is the older teen  This role is his first major part   he too is excellent  Now I am saving the best for last  the writer director  Luke Eberl is not yet 23 years old  For a first effort a big thumbs up  I do hope he as well as our 2 lads have a long career  Ratings       out of 4  86 points out of 100  IMDb 8  out of 10
