Oh I remember watching this show at 4 00 p m  during my junior high days  It was not a pleasant experience because I remember watching it when I made my homework  Still  the show caught my attention when Alex displayed her special powers and dealt with the typical junior high problems  But the show wasn't all about adventures and special powers  it was more of an educational effort for a younger audience in order to get more interested in school and biology overall  The lead actress  can't remember her name and I'm too lazy to copy and paste from the main details  delivered a fantastic performance  She made the show watchable  They just don't make shows like this one anymore
