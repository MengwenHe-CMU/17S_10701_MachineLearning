I have seen 'The Sea Within' today and I loved it  The actors of the movie are wonderful  specially Javier Bardem  of course   but I thought that Bel  n Rueda would have a better role  Lola Due  as  Clara Segura and  specially  Mabel Rivera perform excellent interpretations  And I cannot forget Celso Bugallo and Joan Dalmau  brother and father of the protagonist   There are two technical aspects I loved very much  Aguirresarobe's photography and the score by Amen  bar himself  I liked the song  'Negra sombra'  'Dark Shadow'   by Luz Casal with music of Carlos N    ez  In short  I think that the Spanish Academy should choose 'The Sea Within' in order to compete in the Oscar Awards  I liked other Spanish productions  such as Almod  var's 'Bad Education'  but Amen  bar's film is much better than them  'The Sea Within' deserves all the awards
