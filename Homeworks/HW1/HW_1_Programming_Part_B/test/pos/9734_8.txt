Six-shooter  Tunnel Sergeant  Dr  Death  Pinhead  Cyclops  and Blade help the young Andre Toulon take out Sutek's Egyption henchman in the best sequel this series has seen  Retro Puppet Master is atmospheric with many sets  quality acting and some fun puppet FX  What it lacks in gore  it makes up for with an interesting well-paced plot  Best Quote  Dr  Death   Don't you know  my friends  Smell the sulfur  see the smoke     This is easily the best Dave DeCoteau film I've seen  The actors do a more-than-credible job  Jack Donner as  Azfel  turns in an inspired performance  and the young Toulon does well with the puppets  Oh  and the ring-needle is cool  John Massari's score is a nice symphonic take on the original Puppet Master tunes by Richard Band  keeping the movie playful and eerie  It's rare for a Full Moon score to actually add something to a film  and this one does  Unfortunately  Dave Allen didn't seem to be affordable enough for Band and Co  in the late-90's and beyond  so all of the puppet action is done rod and string  There's no stop motion such as the famous and funny scene in the original where Pinhead's looking for his pinhead  And  of course  as with all of the Full Moon fare of this time period  RPM was shot in and around Castel Studios in Bucharest  so most of the bit parts were cast to Romanians  hearing their  Parisian  accents was a bit annoying  All in all  this is probably one of the top-10 Full Moon films  It's certainly the most inventive of the Puppet Master sequels
