I was very disappointed when this show was canceled  Although i can not vote  I live on the island of Aruba  I sat down to see the show on tuesday  And was very surprised that it didn't aired  The next day i read on the internet that it was canceled  It's true not every one was as much talented as the other  But there were very talented people singing  I find it very sad for them  That they worked so hard and there dreams came tumbling down  Its a pity Ariette Croes
