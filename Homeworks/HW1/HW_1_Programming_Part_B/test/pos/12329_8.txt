I have great memories of this movie    I was only 12 when it was released and it scared the bejesus out of me  I really miss my bejesus    Zombies  graveyards  mausoleums  how can you go wrong  It's like Phantasm's retarded cousin  This movie was released 1 year before the PG-13 rating was instituted  I submit that One Dark Night is the GORIEST PG movie  not scariest  mind you  that has ever been released  Can anyone come up with a gorier pick   FYI  I don't consider Poltergeist to be gorier   scarier  yes  But not gorier
