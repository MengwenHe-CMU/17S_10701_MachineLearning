God bless Joe D'Amato   I love Italian horror  cheese  movie-wise      sci-fi  etc  This one  admittedly  was a bit harder to watch  but another fun BAD movie  I like how people preface a negative review with  I normally enjoy bad movies  but     No buts  this was a bad movie FOR people who love bad movies  It's one of my top bad movies  Miles O'Keefe was a poor man's Conan  but oh what fun  Who can't have fun with a primitive nuclear bomb  a hangglider and a cheesy rubber monster  It's fine to hate this movie if you only like Hollywood drek like  Titanic  or  Pretty Woman  but if you truly  I mean TRULY love bad movies  check this one out  This is one of those movies that are fun to rent for a beerbust or when you have a couple buddies around and looking for a little mindless fun  My rating 8 10
