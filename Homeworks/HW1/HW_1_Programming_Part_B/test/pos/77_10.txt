Julie Andrews plays a German spy who falls in love with an American pilot Rock Hudson  while on an assignment for Germany  The songs are beautiful  The two are well-paired  Julie demonstrates a more temperamental side in this film than the nice girl she normally plays   A half-German  half-English girl who sings beautiful and entertains the troops in WW I  Julie sings some endearing Mancini songs   I loved the film  Some will say it's a  chick-flick   but so what  It's wonderful   Supporting characters are somewhat stereotyped  It may not be up to Rock's performance in Pillow Talk  Magnificent Obsession  or Giant  Blake Edwards shot the film in Ireland and authentic WW I -type planes were used in the film  Scenery for England and France is absolutely gorgeous
