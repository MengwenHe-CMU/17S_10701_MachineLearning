The main reason to check this one out is to watch Laura Gemser in all her glory  That's reason enough for me  She heads to Africa as guests of another rich guy that seems to be all over these films  Huge mansion near the jungle  Hunters staying around for parties when they aren't out hunting zebras  And said parties becoming drunken orgies  All the high society types in the Emanuelle films seem to have out of control fetishes  And Emanuelle beds most of them  Joe D'Amato did NOT direct this one  He just ripped it off and used the same cast s   And did anyone notice the 'subliminal' sexual images at the gas station  And why did most of the men stay dressed during the sex scenes   Coherence  Hardly any  BUT GODDESS GEMSER IS BEAUTIFUL
