Doe-eyed high school student Kathleen Beller is found beaten and raped in the opening scenes of this made for TV movie  The film then flashbacks to the few days before the rape  as Beller is harassed by a stranger  Beller and Scott Colomby and her best friend Robin Mattson and Dennis Quaid are double dating early on  Beller's anxious parents  laid back Tony Bill and shrill Blythe Danner  wait at home wringing hands and so on  Right away  the 1970's makes its dated entrance  as the young couples discuss the romance and love in  Three Days of the Condor   Beller  an amateur photographer  begins getting threatening notes stuffed in her locker at school  The film makers wisely give us a whole slew of suspects  Beller's new boyfriend  Mattson's boyfriend  Beller's dad  Beller's ex-boyfriend  and what about that overly friendly photography class teacher who wants Beller to be a little more sexy in her self-portraits  I knew who the rapist was because the Worldvision Video company video box has a picture of the attack on the back cover  destroying any suspense in that regard  Without giving away who the attacker is  Beller begins getting harassing phone calls  and is eventually raped  The movie then heads south as she makes like Nancy Drew and secretly sets up a time lapse camera to catch the guy stalking another student  Finally  the film makers tack on a hokey ending narration from Beller about the lack of understanding for the victims of rape in that day and age  The suspense here is very real  without going over the top into scary movie stuff  Beller is very good  and watch for her and Mattson's scene in an abandoned theater- both do great jobs  The film is full of familiar faces  including Ellen Travolta in a small role  and everyone is professional  This was made in 1978  and it shows  I am sure no one had any idea that this would be reviewed in 2001 by an overcritical horror movie lover who needs to get to bed and be up early in the morning  but some of the attitudes here are embarassing  The teacher who tells Beller to be sexy is never made to explain what exactly he had in mind  Nowadays  if any high school teacher said that  then THAT would have been a made for TV movie on its own  After Beller is raped  the rapist is still a part of her life  as warrants are issued  blah  blah  blah  There may not be a case because Beller is not a virgin  and cannot prove she was raped by whom she said  Many of these problems have been addressed with modern technology and policing efforts  but this film obviously knew it would have a chance to add to the reform debate  Rape is an act of violence that has not gone away  but efforts today to catch the attackers are miles ahead of twenty four years ago  The problem is the anti-rape angle feels tacked on  like an afterthought  Before that  we have a tight little suspenser that has real honest to God characterization  After the rape  everything changes  filmwise  and not for the better  I remember Beller from the '70's and '80's  and who could forget her revealing role in  The Betsy    but she has not done anything in almost ten years  This is a shame  since she was very good way back then  I will recommend  Are You in the House Alone    based on the acting alone  with a reluctant nod to at least the first two-thirds of the film  If you want to relive 1970's made for TV high school life  this is your cup of Tab  This is unrated but contains physical violence  some sexual violence  and some adult situations
