   I cannot believe I was hooked on this show instantly  after seeing the first scene I was in it deep   Anyway  first of all the guys are hot  Cappy  Evan  Calvin  Fischer  Cappy  Heath  Cappy etc  Secondly  the girls are cute  sexy  smart and are not afraid of being called bitches  I like that  Which at the same time doesn't make them mean and greedy  just realistic  Third the relationships are so great  especially Casey and Cappy  Lately every show turns very away from it's original path and people end up with someone who wasn't even in the first season  Cappy and Casey's relationship is true love  a kind that lasts  They loved each other throughout the years and it didn't end when a guest star appeared   In todays world maybe it's kind of unbelievable for two people to love each other for a long time but it happens  And people define each other in college so I knew exactly who I wanted to be with in college  Just like Casey and Cappy   I HOPE THERE ARE MANY MORE SEASONS OF THIS SHOW AND I HOPE WE CAN SEE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CASEY AND CAPPY NOW THAT THEY WILL PROBABLY STAY TOGETHER  at Thanksgiving    Love this show
