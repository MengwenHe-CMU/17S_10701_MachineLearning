This is a gem of a film  Slapstick violence a-plenty  Simon pegg and Green Spew  A suspicious looking power plant and an incontrollable motorbike add to this stonker   If you haven't seen this I can highly recommend it  maybe not quite as good as bottom but not far short  If you have never seen a man impaled by the nose on two hooks then what are you waiting for buy this film  I didn't even see the twist at the end coming when it turns out that Ritchie and Eddie are both ghosts  Feeb - 1 boiled egg
