Out of any category  this is one demented and over the edge film  even in todays standards  Filmed entirely in crap-o-rama  this film will blow your mind  and something else too   The amount of hilarious bad taste and sleaze is astonishing  The dialog is breathtakingly fast and campy  You'll either love or hate this film  but give it go  I've seen it 4 times and absolutely love it  Divine is in the quest for being the filthiest person alive  but so are her rivals too in this obscene and disgusting  but funny  and stylish little film   Divine was phenomenal  and  she  will always be missed greatly  Edith Massey does the unforgettable performance as the  egglady  and don't forget the energetic Mink Stole    ber crazy s  t   Recommended also for you sick little puppies  Female Trouble  Desperate Living  Polyester
