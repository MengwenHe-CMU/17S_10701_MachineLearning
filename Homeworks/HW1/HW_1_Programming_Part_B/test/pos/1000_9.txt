I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film  While I am not at all a fan of British drama  I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made  I was in tears by the end of the film  Every scene was mesmerizing  The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressive  I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable character         SPOLIER ALERT         I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance      END SPOILER      Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen  but it was Sienna Miller's performance that was truly Oscar worthy  I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards
