A wealthy young man  raised as a SON OF THE GODS  must confront his Chinese heritage while living in a White world  Although the premise upon which this film is based is almost certainly a biological impossibility and the secret of the plot when revealed at the movie's conclusion makes all which has preceded it faintly ludicrous  the story still serves up some decent entertainment and good acting  Richard Barthelmess has the title role as the sweet-natured Oriental whose life is terribly complicated because he looks Caucasian  Barthelmess keeps the tone of his performance serious throughout  gazing intently into the middle distance  a mannerism he developed during Silent Days  whenever his character is indecently misused  He makes no attempt to replicate his classic performance in D  W  Griffith's BROKEN BLOSSOMS  1919  and this is to his credit  Beautiful Constance Bennett is the millionaire's daughter who makes Barthelmess miserable  She is gorgeous as always  but her behavior does not endear her to the viewer and her terrible illness in the final reel is kept mercifully off screen  Multi-talented Frank Albertson has a small role as Barthelmess' improvident buddy  Serene E  Alyn Warren and blustery Anders Randolf play the leading stars' very different fathers  while Claude King distinguishes his brief appearance as the English author who befriends Barthelmess  Movie mavens will recognize little Dickie Moore  uncredited  playing Barthelmess as a tiny child  The original Technicolor of the flashback sequence has faded with time to a ruddy tint  The shot purporting to be the South of France instead looks suspiciously like Avalon on Santa Catalina Island  off the coast of Southern California
