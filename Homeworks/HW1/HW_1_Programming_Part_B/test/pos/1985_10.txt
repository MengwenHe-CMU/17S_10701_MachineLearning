So let's begin     The movie itself is as original as Cronenberg's movies would usually appear    My intention to see it was certainly JJL being one of my favourite actresses  She is as lovely as usual  this cutie  I would not say it was my favourite movie of hers  Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow   The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array     Recommend with confidence
