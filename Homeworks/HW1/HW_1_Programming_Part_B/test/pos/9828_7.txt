Of all the actresses in film today  Kristin Scott Thomas would be my choice if I had to select one for stranding on a desert island  I could watch her simply  say  sitting in a chair for a couple of hours  So it's difficult for me to be objective completely with respect to one of her films  However  I did enjoy this movie and its story  per se  more than that indicated by the average ranking among the many persons previously commenting on this site  Harrison Ford is not one of the actors  though  whose performances I enjoy most  But he's one of a handful who have reached the level of moving from 7 figures to 8 per film  so who am I to argue  Ford though is often droll in his acting style  and sometimes seems to be in serious need of an antacid and a shot of caffeine - and  Random Hearts  is in this grouping  His obsession in probing the losses  which both he and Thomas have endured with regard to their linked spouses  is understandable  given his profession as a detective - but not to the level presented here  Although not far  it crossed the line into the  annoying  category   However  most of the scenes after he and Thomas became involved were interesting and well-played  This film could have been a 9   but I'd lower it a couple of levels  based upon Ford's overall performance  and and another  because it contained a bit more of the extraneous sub-plot elements than seemed required
