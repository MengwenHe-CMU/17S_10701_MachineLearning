I saw the film at the Brooklyn International Film Festival  World Premiere   A haunting  intimate portrait of Loneliness  and the repercussions of letting it grow and turn into something darker  The acting of the two leads  Jessica Bohl   Richard Brundage  is excellent  and makes one wish you had met these characters before they became so damaged  Reminded me in theme of the works of Atom Egoyan  Exotica  and Raymond Carver  Where I'm Calling From   The Soundtrack  Tywanna Jo Baskette  Crooked Fingers  is excellent and reinforces moments in the film without drawing attention to itself  Highly recommend the Film and the Soundtrack
