I just want To say that this movie was excellent   I loved it from the beginning until the end   The acting was great  The director did an amazing job and I would like to see it again  Jennifer Tilly did a very good performance   The guy that interpreted his father  Manny  was another great actor BUT I CAN NOT RECALL HIS NAME   I can't wait for El Padrino II  Damian Chapa looks so good and I think he is one of the most talented actors out there  There is pleanty of Latin actors that do a great job like it is shown in this film  Rent It    Rent it     Rent it
