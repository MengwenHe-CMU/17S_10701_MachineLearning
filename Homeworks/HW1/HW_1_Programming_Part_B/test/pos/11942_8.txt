I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10  It had an excellent plot  and Peter Coyote and Michele Lee  as well as the rest of the cast  did their parts well  Both Peter and Michele were too long in the tooth for the ages their characters were supposed to be  and their children in the film  obviously would have been better suited being their grandchildren  I missed the first ten minutes of this film  so I don't know just how that body turned up after 25 years and got traced back to Denny Traynor  Peter Coyote's character   but I had no difficulty picking up on the storyline  Barbara Traynor  Michele Lee  is stunned when her long-time husband  Denny is arrested for a murder in Oregon some 25 years previous  a state Denny claims he was never in  However  as evidence piles up against Denny  his story changes  Then his story changes again and yet again  until Barbara doesn't know what to believe  Barbara makes up her mind  however  to get to the bottom of the mystery whirling around the fateful time Denny and a young girl named Sherry accepted a ride from a stranger named Wayne Kennedy  that ended in murder  I found the film entertaining  well paced  and it kept me guessing as to what had really happened between those three people  From what I saw during the closing credits  this seemed to be based on a true story
