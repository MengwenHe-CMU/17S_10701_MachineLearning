It would seem a given  but if a viewer forgets context  he risks missing an opportunity of enjoyment  It is easy to carp  from the lofty heights of the 21st century  at styles and prices of the Great Depression years  but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word   context   and better understand and  thus  enjoy  Accidents Will Happen    Among the actors  Ronald Reagan again showed himself a good-looking and personable guy  and again gave a right-on performance  A reviewer earlier said Gloria Blondell played the nasty wife  but that was wrong  She plays the concession-stand clerk who has a crush on the Reagan character  Eric Gregg  but keeps hands off as long as he is married  Gloria was cute  Not as lushly beautiful as her sister  Joan  she was still attractive and a good actress  Perhaps her looking somewhat like Joan was a detriment to having a more successful career  and it is certainly our loss  Sheila Bromley was Mrs  Gregg  and played it well  Other actors included Dick Purcell  and the great Earl Dwire got to play something besides a villainous cowboy  Again  most of the players never attained the  household-name  status many of them deserved  but they by gosh gave good performances here  in a story that is still current
