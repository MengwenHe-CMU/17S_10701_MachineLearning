Not for those adrenaline maniacs etc It's a good movie  looking at after war  psychical problem  from the other point of view   Emilio Estevez is great as a young man  haunted by the demons of Vietnam war  causing problem in family   Marin Sheen is also good as a conservative father  It all comes down to the problem how to deal with the past  with whom Emilion Estevez's character can't seem to deal  and Martin Sheen's character don't want do deal with  Protective mother looks at this problem with warm   and open heart but with her mind closed for the obvious reasons
