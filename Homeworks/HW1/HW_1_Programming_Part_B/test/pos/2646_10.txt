In 1968  Stanley Kubrick made this historic film masterpiece base on a book written by Arthur C  Clark  It was such an early effort to make a science fiction movie combined with scientific facts  His style of movie making is still fresh and intact  I have seen this movie more that half a dozen times and I even have a VHS copy of the movie in my library  CS3 class made me to see the movie again with another perspective  Who is HAL and what is he thinking  I enjoyed watching the movie again and tried to focus of HAL's dialogues throughout the second episode of the movie  In the second scene  Dr  Dave Bowman and Dr  Frank Poole are eating their food in front of two TV monitor on their sides and HAL's round reddish glass dome is in the middle of them  In the TV report  HAL was introduced as the new generation of super computer put in work in January 12  1992 called HAL 9000 Series  During the interview HAL reacts as a humble working machine trying to accomplish the mission of the spaceship fully   In another scene  Dave is sketching Dr  Hunter  Dr  Kambel and Dr  Kaminsky who they are all in Hibernation sleep  HAL is curious to see those sketches and brings up his doubtful question about the purpose of the Jupiter mission  His calm and monotone voice makes the audience listen to him more carefully   In the next few scenes we will see how HAL tries to kill astronauts one by one and takes the power  His conscious makes him capable to try to save his life from termination  When Dave wants to return to the spaceship and HAL does not listen to him  there is the most memorable line of the move  ' I'm sorry Dave  I am afraid I can't do that  ' In the middle of the most important interact between human and machine  HAL's voice can conjure both solid calm and malevolence in the same monotone   Dave has gone back to the ship  lost all his fellow astronauts  and determined to disconnect the HAL's main brain cells  HAL uses his final apologetic techniques to convince Dave of not disconnecting him  HAL begs him to stop and let him correct himself  These are his famous lines while Dave is disconnecting his modules one by one  'Dave  what do you think you are doing  Dave  I am entitled to the answer of the question  I know everything is not quiet right with me recently   But I feel much better know   I can see are really upset about this very poor decision of mine recently   Dave  stop  Will you  Dave  stop  I am afraid Dave ' HAL's voice is slowing down during this process and becomes thicker and less audible  'my mind is going   I can feel it' 'Can I sing a song for you ' Dave is putting final modules out and let HAL to sing his song called 'Daisy'  'Daisy give me   your answer to me   I am crazy   Although I am not confused  ' HAL dies as the Jupiter Mission continues   Artificial God bless you HAL  store in peace
