Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya is based on somewhat pat formula by now of Japanese school drama anime  The formula somewhat goes like this  1  The main protagonist comes from world outside the normal society  and has super powers  2  There's a very beautiful and sexy girl in a supporting role  3  A normal character is in there who shares the main role in the story  4  Unusual things happens in an usual social settings  5  Sometimes the story is about the main protagonist  and the normal character that connects to the existence or destruction of the world  6  Absolutely no effort is spent by anyone to gain all the magical powers  They just have it  7  Usually  people outside of this tight nit group is not aware of their super powers  and goes on with their daily lives  So there you have it  Melancholy of Suzumiya Haruhi is made along these lines which became the success formula for comics and anime in Japan  Even though it follows a pat formula  the series is superbly crafted and the episodes are always set in an interesting back drop within the normal social settings which always morphs into unusual circumstances surrounding Haruhi Suzumiya  Each player in the story brings some unusual insight into the daily life that usually we are not aware of  The philosophical twist of their insights are what makes this series extra entertaining  The visuals are first rate  and done beautifully   The crazy ideas Haruhi always seem to come up with along with complicated settings of the story may give you headache from time to time  It's further complicated by the fact that the episodes are played out of sequence which further adds to the confusion  When I watched the episodes in the chronological sequence  some of the plots finally made sense  I recommend you do the same  It's much more entertaining to watch the series this way  Google List_of_The_Melancholy_of_Haruhi_Suzumiya_episodes for the correct sequence of all the episodes  And oh  you might notice the headache while you're watching this like I did  Let me know if you had it too
