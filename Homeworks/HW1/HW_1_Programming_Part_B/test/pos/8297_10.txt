Once a year in America  Saturday morning would give way to new cartoons  usually sometime in America  Just about the time school started  I guess this was to make not having school on Saturdays that more bearable  One Friday night before the premiere of the new Saturday morning cartoons  a movie came on   At The Earth's Core  I had not a clue who Cushing nor McClure were  Clearly they were not from the same country  so I couldn't grasp why they were traveling together  I do recall seeing the mechanism in the fire-breathing monster's mouth  What connects this movie for me is the opening with the molten metal and then suddenly we get the band playing as we see the factory  How do you end a movie like this  The music again  and two bewlidered cops as the drill appears behind them  Whatever reason  I remember watching this movie more that Friday night than I do any new cartoon that came on the following morning  That was definitely the late seventies  It would be during Jurassic Park mania  cicra '93  I believe  before I would see this movie again  Yes  people in costumes  There was the fire-breather again  Still loved the ending with the two cops  Finally  it would be nearly another decade before I would send off for the movie on DVD  Now I would just watch the beginning and intro  Oh  I do love much of the movie  Of all these sci fi Jules Verne  HG Wells  ERB movies  this one stands as my fave  What I note now is that one of the cops begins turning around a wee bit too soon  then turns back  then he and the other cop are synchronized as they turn inward once again to look behind themselves at the drill  Perhaps for me  this movie stands as the best of the Saturday morning shows  which is why I enjoy it so much
