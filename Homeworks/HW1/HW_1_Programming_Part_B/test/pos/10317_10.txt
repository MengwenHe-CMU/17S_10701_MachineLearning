Not wishing to repeat what everyone else has noted  I will only say this   Nearly everybody says they loved Curly best    but I will put BRIDELESS GROOM up against ANY of other the Stooges shorts   I think it's the most hilarious from start to finish  as well as being the most re-watchable  The off-key singing student    Christine McIntire's  Cousin Basil  routine  and of course Emil Sitka's J P  are highlights  but only around the Stooges' impeccable timing and the great writing too  Nuff said
