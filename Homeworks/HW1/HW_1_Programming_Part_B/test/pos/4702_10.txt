Oh so beautiful  oh so tearful and so gut-wrenching   Makes everything seem so superficial  so pale  so meaningless in comparison   Sister Helen is not a real saint   She is a real human - flawed  raw and blunt  but passionate and with a heart of gold  What I found most interesting is that this handful of wretched  miserable people found meaning and laughter  What I loved most is how the documentary portrayed the polarity of human nature
