A truly accurate and unglamourous look into modern day life  It could be set in any town in the UK   I live in a housing estate in Glasgow and can relate to this film very well  Sadly the situations and characters are all too realistic but not predictable  The actors are scarily believable  I felt as if I was spying on my neighbours  It was an intimate dip into the lives of fragile and hopeless people  I was very moved by a few scenes  I loved the way this film was shot  Overall this film IS a must see
