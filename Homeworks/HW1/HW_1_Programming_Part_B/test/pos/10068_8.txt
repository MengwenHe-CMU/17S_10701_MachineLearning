 What's his name    Loudon    Loudon what    Clear   That gag still gets me  TWENTY ONE years after the film was released  I loved the film back then and I love it today  I must have watched this a hundred times back in the day  and when I bought the DVD recently I could still remember some of the dialogue  Madonna plays Nikki Finn  a young woman jailed for a crime she didn't commit  When she gets out she decides to seek revenge  Griffin Dunne  whatever happened to him    plays an attorney for his fianc  e's father  John McMartin   The future father-in-law asks Loudon to take Nikki from prison to the bus station and to make sure she gets on the bus  as part of a supposed new public relations programme  A seemingly easy task  but there are complications aplenty  some funny dialogue  and some admittedly stupid-but-funny scenes along the way  Madonna has a stupid voice in this film  which until I was able to watch with subtitles made one or two lines of dialogue incomprehensible for me  hence only 8 10   but on the other hand I can't imagine her doing it in her normal voice  This film shows Madonna's comic side  too lacking these days  perhaps   and she genuinely is funny in the role  Dunne makes a great foil  while Haviland Morris is perfect as the uppity fianc  e  Yes  it's predictable  yes  the jokes could be better  but I think this is a great film and will happily sit down and watch it 100 times more
