Well  first of all  it's not a bad movie  It is good  and I like the characters introduced  I also like Lady and Tramp's voices more in this  However  I would like to see Lady And Tramp more  I know it says 'Scamp's Adventure'  and I love Scamp And Angel to bits  but it's a sequel to the original  where in my opinion  they should of just released it as 'Scamp's Adventure'  not 'Lady And The Tramp II Scamp's Adventure'  Tramp did have quite a role  but he didn't have much time with Lady  But anyway  the songs are quite good  and Scamp and Angel are sweet  I've seen better sequels  but hey  it's not a failure  I give it 7 10  Very good  but still had flaws
