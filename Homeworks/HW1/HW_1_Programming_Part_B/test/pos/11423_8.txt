Stan as a bullfighter  and a good one  is quite a surprise  Usually overshadowed by Oliver Hardy  this silent short allows him to take the lead  and the limelight  One can only draw the conclusion that his character  Rhubarb Vaselino  was a parody of the many Rudolph Valentino movies of this era  Be prepared to laugh yourself silly at some of the dialog  and keep an eye on the special effects  I viewed this on DVD in a Vol 1   2 collection
