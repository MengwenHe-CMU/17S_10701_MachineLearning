Best fan boy movie I've ever watched save  Free Enterprise   In some ways it reminded me of an early Kevin Smith film  If you do any kind of role playing  this movie will likely have you laughing often at its insatiable fun  Don't expect a big budget here  the acting is also questionable at times  but it really adds to the fun of the atmosphere they create  The script is truly humorous with a lot of witty moments worth experiencing  The bard that always gets killed had me rolling  The sexually confused player also had me smiling a bit too  But in the end    It was just a great movie showcasing some better moments in the lives of a few geeks having a great time with role playing  If you are bored  and ever got into role playing  this will do nicely for a distraction  A real unexpected treat
