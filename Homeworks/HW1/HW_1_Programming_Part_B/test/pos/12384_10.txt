Seriously  I don  t really get why people here are bashing it  I mean  the idea of a killer snowman wreaking havoc on a tropical island paradise is pretty absurd  The good news is  the producers realized it and made it a comedy in the vein of Army of Darkness   Especially in the second half of the film  when the little killer snowballs attack  I laughed my ass off  For example  the put one of the little creeps into a blender  a la Gremlins 1  and mix it  After that  it morphs back into a snowball and squeals with a high pitched voice  That was fun    Bottom line - incredible movie  rent it
