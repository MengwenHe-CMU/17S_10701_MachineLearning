If you can watch a Bond film from 1983 that isn't as good as Octopussy and still enjoy it  If you can accept production values which aren't that much above the level of a TV movie  If you can look at Sean Connery with wrinkles on his forehead beneath an obvious toup  e and still see James Bond  If you can get past an inexperienced Basinger  a weaker Largo and a jolly Q  If you can learn to love an idiosyncratic score  not up there with Barry on his worst day  If you don't believe the hyperbolic reviews that it was greeted with on release  If you can meet a poker battle and a video game face off and enjoy them both the same  Yours is Never Say Never Again and everything that's in it  And  what is more  you'll probably enjoy it  my son
