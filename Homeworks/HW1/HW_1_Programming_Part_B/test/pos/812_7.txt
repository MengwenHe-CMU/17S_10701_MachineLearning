   and I'm so disappointed because I can't seem to buy the DVD or VHS of it anywhere  Its a kind of mix of  Uncle Buck and The Great Outdoors and Molly Ringwald is fabulous as the spoilt teenager  This was made when Molly was still a brunette  just before she hit the big time with Pretty In Pink  I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good clean family comedy  with an edge   If anyone has a copy of this  or knows where I can get one   please leave a message for me - it'll be much appreciated
