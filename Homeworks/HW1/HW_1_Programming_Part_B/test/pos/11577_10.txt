Since many other users have already explained and commented the storyline  I won't do it  However  I'd like to restate that Bardem's interpretation is terrific  as also are those of the other actors and actresses in this film   Reading the previous comments I've noticed that some people criticize the fact that the film doesn't show points of view opposed to euthanasia and that those little present are ridiculed  In my honest opinion this is far from true  There are many characters that move in a gray zone between loving Ram  n Sampedro and wanting him to stay  and understanding his desire to die  Most obvious of those are the family  For instance  Ram  n's sister-in-law never talks for or against euthanasia  Another such character is Gen    the social rights activist  who  in the last moment  tells Ram  n to re-think it all  The scene clearly shows that she doesn't want him to die  Then there are characters who are clearly against euthanasia  Ram  n's brother is clearly against it  as is his father   There's only one thing worse than the death of son  and it's having a son that wants to die    Other users have commented that the discussion between Ram  n and the priest is ridiculed and filmed to make us think that Ram  n is GOOD and the priest is BAD  Well  no doubt the scene is comic  but that doesn't mean the priest is caricatured or ridiculed  From my point of view  the comedy in this scene comes from the fact that the priest is trying to convince Ram  n to keep on living using arguments totally alien to Ram  n's thinking  The priest's speech goes on the line of  God gives and God takes    We aren't the owners of our own lives  they belong to God     and so on  The comedy arises from the fact that Ram  n is atheist and all the priest is saying to him is therefore nonsense  This film is the antithesis of manicheism  it leaves the spectator the chance to think on the subject and make up his her own opinion  And above anything else is a chant of FREEDOM
