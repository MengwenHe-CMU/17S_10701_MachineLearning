I am so impressed  really  I expected cheesy gamer humor and nothing else  OK  there's a ton of pretty geeky humor  But the movie is so well done  The acting is quite good  The dialog  while gamer cheesy at times  I guess to cater to the gamer crowd  is not bad at all  At times it's even  dare I say  great  When the female gamer  who built this non traditional fighter type character rather then the usual  min max  type gets all these additional attacks  seem right  I did not check the rules   it was cool  The sets are amazing for what must be a fairly low production movie  The story moves right along  The transitions from game world to real world are well done  A male playing a female character would sometimes be played by a female  and sometimes by himself  Pretty clever  I thought  The guy who decided to play a female  but kept forgetting he was female was good for a lot of laughs  He even said tag at one point  and the female walked on to play the role   sorry  I did not look her name up  she did great though   The guy always trying to  get some   got a bit tedious  but I guess that was more gamer humor  There was just so much to like about the movie  Lighthearted  Fun  Very well done and I am saying that as a movie fan  not a gamer  and I am not a D D player   As I said I expected SO much less  Movies often don't hold my attention  I end up listening to them while working on my computer  This one held my attention  I can't give a movie much higher praise
