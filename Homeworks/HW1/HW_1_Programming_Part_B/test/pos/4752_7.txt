This movie is not about the soda nor is it quite the French Connection  The Seven Ups are a group of elite policemen that use tactics not in accordance with protocol of the NYPD  Scheider heads the group with his posse or regular looking joes  They are running surveillance on a local costra nostra cartel and things go awry when a cop's wire is found out  Meanwhile  Richard Lynch  the most evil looking man in film  Invasion America  Little Nikita  and his partner end up killing the cop by accident and escape from Scheider in the coolest chase scene I've seen  Bullitt and French Connection are not as good as they one up the West Side to the George Washington and onto the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey   The stunt drivers are terrific and Lynch makes it away free though he looks scared witless from the dangerous trip  Roy Scheider is nearly killed when his car slams into the abutted rear of Mack truck ripping the roof of his vehicle off   Things come to a head and one has to keep watching to follow up on such a sequence  Quick moving and intense  fresh for a thirty years
