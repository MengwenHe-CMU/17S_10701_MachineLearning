I'm not sure how I can make ten lines out of this question  but I'll try  When Julie went to the dance and they were dancing to slow music  What was the name of the song that was playing and who played it   I love that song  And I watch the movie over and over just to hear that one song  I did several searches online and even looked up the soundtrack but I sill can't find the song  It might be because the song they were dancing to wasn't a complete song and just partial  I would appreciate if anyone out there who knows what the name of the song and the group who sung it  Thank you  Frank
