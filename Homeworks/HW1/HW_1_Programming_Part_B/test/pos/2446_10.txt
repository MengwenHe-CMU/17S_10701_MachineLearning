I would like to know if  The Outsiders   Australian TV series  will ever be released on DVD sometime in the future  And is the music  Title Theme  available on CD  There was only one series of 13 episodes of this drama and should have gone on to at least three or even four series in total  The Young German Actor in the series was also in a German TV series called  Black Forest Clinic  which aired here in the UK with English dialogue superimposed with the lip-sync   I look forward to hearing any comments from TV Industry personnel on the above questions  thank you in advance
