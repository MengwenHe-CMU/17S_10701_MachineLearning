This short film  and the poem which is behind it  is one of the greatest metaphors I've ever seen   The poem is beautiful  It describes exactly the feeling of a person that chases a dream and can't realize it   but it also tells how to fulfil it  I see the  Story of the Cat and the Moon  as one beautiful metaphor to the Human relationships  passion and love   Technically it's done a good work too  In spite of being very simple  the animation  in black and white  gives a tone of allegory to the movie and to its message  but also of tenderness and nostalgia   In addiction  the music also contributes to this poetic feeling    Nothing else matters  I will wait  She will come when she can  or when she wants to
