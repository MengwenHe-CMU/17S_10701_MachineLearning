Certainly the highlight of this film is it's cast  Diana Rigg  George C  Scott  Bernard Hughes to mention a few  I have accumulated more time in hospitals and with doctors over the years than I care to think about  This comedy attacks the pomp and pretension in all aspects of our society  through the setting of one of it's  Most Haughty  institutions    the Medical profession  The idea that such goings on could be possible  might be a shock to some  but is a delight to anyone with the perspective of experience  Dr Brock  Scott  undergoes a mid-life crisis of monumental proportions before our eyes as we  and he  become enamored with the prospect of his involvement with Miss Drummond  Rigg   The thread of the absurd is woven into this wonderful mix in the form of the irony that the Hospital appears to be killing it's own workers as they mismanage their affairs in it  The climax is unpredictable  unless you've seen it  and made even more hilarious if you happen to guess  It's not everyone's brand of humor  to be sure  and has uproariously funny  Dark Moments  if you're open to them  I loved every minute  and was delighted to see it out on DVD
