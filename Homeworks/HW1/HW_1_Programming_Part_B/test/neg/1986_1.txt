This is one of the worst films I have seen in a while  The problem is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film  'artistic' or an exercise is eroticism  As a result it fails on all accounts  The acting is atrocious  the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointless  Klaus Kinski is probably the best thing about this film but that isn't a good thing  Sure he has an intense and 'unique' look but ultimately he can't actually act  Just look at how he reacts when his mistress leaves     Really don't watch this film  some say it needs repeat viewings I say one is too many
