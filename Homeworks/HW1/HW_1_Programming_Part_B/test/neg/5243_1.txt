Without doubt  this is the worst movie I've ever seen  Poor acting  Poor script  Poor direction and poor production  Why did they even bother  This entire movie was total nonsense  Suspension of disbelief can only carry so far  but this pushes the limits completely  For a movie with no humour content  the audience laughed disturbingly often
