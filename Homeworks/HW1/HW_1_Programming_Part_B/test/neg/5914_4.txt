by Dane Youssef I was kind of looking forward to this one  I enjoy Eddie Murphy and I love it when a star hand-makes a vehicle for themselves or when someone who writes decides to mark their own directorial debut  But when the star's head gets too big for the rest of his body  there's always a danger of a big-budgeted Hollywood vanity production  Will the filmmaker keep it real   or will he just waste amounts of money  the studio's  ours  and time  the studio's  ours   his own  patting himself on the back for an hour in a half  Sadly  it's the latter here  Another thing I really like is when someone breathes new and fresh life into an exhausted and dried-out genre  None of that here  The warring nightclub movies have become so worn-through that even the parodies of it are dreary and done to death   Murphy does neither  He does the most clich  d  He plugs into a routine conventional formula gangster picture and plays it as seriously as if it were  The Godfather   It's like a script where the next draft  they put in the jokes and the new ideas  But it seems like someone with clout just looked at it and went   No   this is fine   Probably Murphy  He is credited all over this  In the opening shot of beautiful white satin sheets  his name headlines across the credits about five times  THE PLOT  A young orphan saves Pryor's life and Pryor adopts the little ragamuffin   20 years later  Pryor's dump has become a first-class hot spot  They're pulling down big money and a gangster wants their action  He's even got a dirty cop in his employ  But Pryor comes up with a scheme  a la  THE STING    Murphy's screenplay plays like an unfinished first-draft that nobody had the pair to call him on  The actors aren't really allowed to stand-out much  if at all  Even the almighty Murphy seems to be on auto-pilot   Pryor shows class and gentlemanly manners as Sugar Ray  perhaps it would have been better to name his character BROWN Sugar Ray  further evidence that this one needed a polish   but everyone here is basically just on vacation   The Oscar-nomination the movie received is richly deserved  Joe I  Tompkins' Best Costume Design   but the production values are the only part that makes the '30's feel authentic   Some sets look somewhat fake  but this is supposed to be a comedy of sorts  It's rare one movie gets nominated for both a Razzie and an Oscar  unless it's one of Lucas' new  Star Wars  chapters   It's 1938 and everyone is talking like it's 1988  particularly the comedians  This is a prehistoric white man's formula  And with all these black comedians and satirists  you expect them to skewer the genre or at least bring new life to it  Nope  Murphy is pretty much just coasting here  The great Roger Ebert summed it up perfectly when he remarked in his review   Murphy approaches his story more as a costume party in which everybody gets to look great while fumbling through a plot that has not been fresh since at least 1938    Jasmine Guy is perfectly cast and seems to be indulging herself in her role and Michael Lerner has all the looks  evil and mannerisms of the prototypical mob boss down pat  And there are moments where Pryor gives you an idea of what a more interesting leader and authority figure would sound like  He gives every scene he's in a feeling of dignity  Would it have been too much to ask that Della Resse sing  Or at least quit embarrassing herself with all her  Kiss My Ass talk    And the late Redd Foxx doesn't get to leave much of a swan song here  He has some back-and-forth with Resse which could have been some great stuff  Nope  Murphy wastes another opportunity again here  Murphy's Quick is charismatic and likable  But those moments are few and far between for sure  Murphy has never looked better and never been duller  His character made me laugh twice throughout the whole movie  Stan Shaw's boxer with a horrible speech impediment isn't just painful and embarrassing  it's annoying  There's more to comedy than simply showing something unpleasant  You have to incorporate some kind of light touch and funny situation  Watching him strain even the some of the easiest words just makes us feel sorry for him and annoyed with Murphy  Can Murphy write a screenplay  Well   there was  Raw   but that was really stand-up material  He wrote the outline for  Boomerang  and  Coming to America  for sure  But her didn't have the last word there  Maybe a team of ER-like script doctors could've revived this one  Murphy's direction is so slow and quiet  you'd swear he was asleep at the wheel some of the time  He has too many static shots and doesn't seem to know how to build and release suspense  On some level  I think Quick is the real Eddie Murphy  Angry  young  hot-headed and ambitious  But occasionally charming  Now if he were only funny sometime  There's a scene in which Murphy has a femme fa-tale in bed who plans to make love with him and kill him  You can probably guess how it turns out  Like everything else in the movie  this could have been better  but     Surprisingly   Murphy has not directed another movie since  he got a Razzie nomination   And he no longer writes the finished draft for his films either  he WON the Razzie for writing this    It's great to look at and the music is beautiful  and there are a few really nice scenes  But that just falls under the category of  gems among all the junk   Not enough of them  Couldv'e been  Shouldv'e been  Wasn't  Oh  well  by Dane Youssef
