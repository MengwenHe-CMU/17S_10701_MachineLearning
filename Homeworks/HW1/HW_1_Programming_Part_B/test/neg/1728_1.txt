I found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed  Basically  Dr  Crawford  Dennis Hopper  has predicted a meteor will hit the earth  The  powers that be  don't believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people  Jake Lowe  Peter Onorati  is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains  He sets out to investigate  While trying to get into the secret survival shelter Jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives  He spends the rest of his time bitching at Dr  Crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor  I found myself wishing Jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself  Don't waste your time on this turkey
