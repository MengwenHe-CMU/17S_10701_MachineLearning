The price of a dream - and some dreams can be  too  expensive  Only having viewed the English-translated version  it is perhaps the reason for a low rating from this viewer  It made the overall film poorer than the story material hinted at       and other comments seem to suggest the subtitled version would be better  But some plot elements remained unexplained  leaving an unfinished feel  It also leaves the thought  is there a series to follow    A pity there was no more  at this stage at least  anyway
