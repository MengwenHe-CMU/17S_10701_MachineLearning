Here's what's good about  The Slaughter Rule   --Ryan Gosling  Clea Duvall  and David Morse all give great performances  Gosling is  as always  pretty darn outstanding  The locales are often breathtaking  Here's what's bad about  The Slaughter Rule   --Everything else  The script is horribly muddled  And while I can certainly appreciate a non- feel good  movie  this movie is just boring  Great performances can't make-up for a movie with a stupid premise and a script that is filled with throw-away lines that often don't even make it sense  Just getting through the first hour became a chore  I stuck with it because of Gosling  but eventually I did myself a favor and changed the channel  Spoilers on here relayed the ending to me  I didn't miss much  Do yourself a favor--if you want a good Gosling flick  check out  The Believer   My score  2 out of 10
