How in the name of decency did this film ever get made   One presumes the subtitles merely say 'awful' on every single frame of this truly dismal effort  Horrendous acting  woeful dialogue and the lack of talent from everyone involved in this nightmare make for an excruciating 90 minutes  Overall impression   A bunch of excitable drama students got lucky with a lottery grant and proceeded to make one of the most painful films ever made  This makes Hammer Horror TV shows look like Oscar material  And don't for a second think this falls into the 'so bad it's good' category  It's not even that bad  But the fart lighting scene is probably worth another look
