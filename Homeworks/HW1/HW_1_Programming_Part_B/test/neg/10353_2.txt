I watched the first episode and I found it to be a very wooden performance  I have watched the original from it's early days on Big Girls Blouse to the last series on Channel seven  Kath and Kim was a great Mocumentary and it's humor is something that most people get  However in this American version I found it to be dull  Molly Shannon is to fashionable to be Kath Day  Kath's wardrobe is supposed to be stuck in the 80s with her frizzy perm  While Selma Blair's figure hugging clothes isn't as good as what the original Kimmy wore  I also found that Selma seemed to be puffing her belly out a lot  she is obviously a  Australian  size 12 where Kim should be  Australian  a size 16 18  The exchanges from Molly and Selma is obviously so scripted and there is pauses where there shouldn't be pauses or the pauses are a bit long  as someone suggested there could be a laughter track in there during those pauses  It's like Molly and Shannon are not used to each other  there is no Mother Daughter chemistry  Phil was okay he had the eccentric air around him like Kel  However Craig was to handsome and not the sweet plain humble Brett from the Aussie version  I found watching this was like watching a very bad stage play  The acting was pretty much wooden and the exaggeration of Selma's expressions wore the funny off after ten minutes  Especially her sulking scenes  To sum up  I find this show to be a waste of time  the script obviously has been dumbed down for Americans which most on the board say they prefer the original  If NBC wanted to show Kath and Kim why not pay the producers the money to screen the original  All I can add is Magda you are one smart cookie for not letting the producers use your character of Sharon
