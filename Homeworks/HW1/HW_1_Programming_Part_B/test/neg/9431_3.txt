 Shadows and Fog  is surely one of Woody Allen's weakest films  right up there with  September  and  Hollywood Ending   though nothing Allen has done equals the awfulness of  Anything Else     Shadows and Fog  is Allen's homage to the German Expressionist style of film-making  all stark and stylized light and shadow and   you guessed it     lots of fog  But you can tell Allen got caught up in the technique and the parody and forgot to make a movie that anyone would care about  Luckily  he made  Husbands and Wives  the same year  so things weren't a total wash for him  Grade  D
