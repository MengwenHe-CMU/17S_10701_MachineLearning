I think it is very interesting this movie is called a thriller  It is anything but thrilling  Most of the time you hear piano sounds  Then you hear piano sounds  Then some people talk about facts which do not concern anybody  Then again piano sounds  To be honest  this movie was the reason for me to register at IMDb  because I think this movie is one of those which humankind has to be warned of  Spoiler  By the way  the most action-like part happens when a can of hot chocolate is spilled  Also very interesting  The  actors   Yes  the quotes are intentional  as you can think  because they do not act  They play piano and do smalltalk  but it's not acting they do  I think before this movie I never left a cinema and felt angry  Really  this film made me angry  Angry for the time and money I spent on it
