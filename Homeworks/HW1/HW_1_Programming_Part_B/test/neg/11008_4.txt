Although I found the acting excellent  and the cinematography beautiful  I was extremely disappointed with the adaptation  One of the significant portions of the novella is the fact that Ethan and Mattie decide to kill themselves  rather than go on  This is never presented in the movie  they show it as if it were a sledding accident  The character changes in Mattie and Zenna are almost non-existent  While in the novella they almost change places  at the end of this adaptation it appears as if they are both invalids  Lastly that Mattie and Ethan consummate their relationship fully nearly destroys the power and poignancy of the finale  The change of the narrator being a preacher was one effective change  Neeson and Arquette are superb in their portrayals  Joan Allen was also wonderful  however her character was much watered down from Whartons novella  I do not expect films to faithfully portray novels  but this one went to far and in the process nearly destroyed the story  Overall  I would not recommend watching this film unless you have read the book as you will come away confused and disappointed
