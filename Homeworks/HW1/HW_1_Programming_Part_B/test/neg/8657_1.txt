Yash Raj films are so funny  whatever works they follow it yet they are called the best production house  Seeing Bhatt films working they copied the formula  bikini and everything plus casting low actors like Uday and Tanishaa The film is so horrible it makes you cringe the jokes are so bad and horny it makes you slap them Uday resembles a gay plus a monkey Tanishaa resembles an idiot  The director thinks we all are idiots Arjun Sablok takes the audience for granted Music is saving grace Camera-work is good Uday Chopra hams like an idiot  Tanishaa looks like Kajol in K3g if Kajol was annoying der then Tanishaa is worse the rest are okay
