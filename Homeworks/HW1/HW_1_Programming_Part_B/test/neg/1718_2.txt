Tycus is one of the worst films direct to video films that I see ever  I am not amazing that this product does not appearing at the cinema Bad Visual effects  The start is dreadful Bad actors  I don  t understand Why appear in this film the great Dennis Hopper and Bad screen Without sense My alternative Armaggedon or Twister  SENTENCE FOR TYCUS Do not watch this film
