If you want a complete waste of time  because pulling lint out of your belly button or cleaning the wax out of your ears or grouting your tile is your idea of a carnival thrill ride  then you'll not want to miss this one  For one thing  forget the VHS cover  NO body in this movie looks that attractive  ie  the Indian girl   Someone else commented that whoever posed for the cover is not the same girl and I agree  The cover is THE most exciting thing about this movie  To put this in perspective  I bought this VHS for 99 cents at K-Mart and three minutes  no  40 seconds into the movie  I knew I had been ripped off  I finished watching it because 1  I did pay 99 cents after all and  2 there might possibly  conceivably been a hair of chance some scene in this turkey was worth more than a pinched loaf  There wasn't  Good grief  Fonda  I know you were hard up for roles when you did this  but this is beneath you
