I have been a rabid Star Trek fan since 1966  Still am  One thing I learned from Star Trek is that the special effects are secondary to the characters  Encounter At Farpoint fails in its mission  Superbly produced  POORLY directed  written  acted  D C  Fontana really blew this one  This episode is so embarrassing the master tape should be burned  The first half of the first season didn't fare much better
