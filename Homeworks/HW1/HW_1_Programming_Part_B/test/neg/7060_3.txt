I like a lot of Myrna Loy movies  This film was produced before her character actor personality was developed  It would be an okay short film but seems to go on forever in it's complete form  Myrna Loy it seems is told what to do with her acting and does the job  That is about all you can say about her  Her gypsy character is shoddy and the film has many flaws  such as the jewelry shop scene  This film will probably be interesting to Myrna Loy fans but even as such is something of a disappointment
