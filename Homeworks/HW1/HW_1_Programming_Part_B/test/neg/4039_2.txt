As you can tell from the other comments  this movie is just about the WORST film ever made  Let me see how many different words I can use to describe it  Boring  Unbearable  Laughable  Lousy  Stupid  Horrible      I could go on with such descriptions but you probably get the point  I would have given this a 0  if possible--bad acting  bad directing  bad production  bad plot  This was made in 2001 and it looks more like 1965  Very low budget  boring plot  horrible acting  really bad special effects  etc    I rarely ever see a Sci-Fi film I absolutely think is this bad  I mean this is pure garbage  It has nothing going for it either  As far as a  B-movie  this is the very bottom of the lot  I think I would be more entertained by staring at a blank piece of paper for 90 minutes  Junk like this gives good low-budget  B  movies a bad name  This makes Ed Wood movies look good  The thing about watching direct-to-video movies is  just when you think you've seen the worst  you see something even worse  DJ Perry is a horrible actor and has no individual characteristics that make him stand out  Avoid this waste at all costs  Oh the humanity
