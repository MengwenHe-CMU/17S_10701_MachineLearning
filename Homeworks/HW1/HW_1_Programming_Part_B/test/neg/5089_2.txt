wow  i just got one watching this  How CRAPPY post production is on this movie  I kid you not  I literally could've done a better job myself  ALL of post production is flawed  all of it  Whoever cut this film should be banned from the film industry  That aside  the script was a trainwreck  absolute rubish  Not to mention Jack Bauer and his Patchy the Pirate in Spongebob accent  WTF is his character doing there  But to me  the biggest flaw of all was character development  intereaction  dynamics  dialogue  WOW  I cant believe how bad it was  I give this movie a 2 out of 10  1 for Samantha  who is a great actress  too bad the production made everyone look like amateurs out there  the other 1 goes to cinematography  which was indeed good  Other then that my friend  this is one bad movie  I don't even feel like making an elaborate post on this  it was just horrible production  Poor actors  didn't know what they were getting into
