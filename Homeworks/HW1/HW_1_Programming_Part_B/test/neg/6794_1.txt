The fact that this cruddy series could elicit dozens of comments  much less hundreds of 'votes'  speaks volumes as to the decline of Western  or at least American  civilization  Read Proust  you morons   Or at least Dave Barry or Calvin and Hobbes anthologies  Chuck Norris  Wrap your brains around the fact that in order to rate or write about this series you'd have to have spent minutes  nay  HOURS   viewing this poor sod treading the boards and spewing lines with less emotional impact than the gal who used to call off the correct time on your local service  PLEASE DON'T WATCH THIS SHOW   SPARE YOUR FEW REMAINING BRAIN CELLS
