Who wrote this flick  An uninspired 15 year-old  Could have been written by one of the kids who did the Columbine shooting  Totally nonsensical  not funny all  boooooooriiing    Plus this  the French do not put their flag everywhere  You do not walk into a French bank and see the tricolore flag displayed like that  Even on Bastille day  I have nothing against the blood bath thing  It's just that none of this is either credible or funny  Or parodic  or anything like that  Ok  those who liked this flick will tell you I must be some type of fascist  so forget about my comment
