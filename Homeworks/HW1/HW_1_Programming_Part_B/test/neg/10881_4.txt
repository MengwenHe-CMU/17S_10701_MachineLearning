Continuing in the string of  stalker slasher  flicks in the vein of  Wolf Creek    Hostel    Joy Ride   etc   comes  Rest Stop   The most unoriginal and useless one of them all  We start  reasonably promising  with the violent death of a pretty young girl in a filthy restroom  This is where our interest is lost  We  then  move to the clich   road trip couple  on their way to LA with their eyes on acting stardom      which  doing movies like this  they'll never achieve  From the sexual romp in the park  the couple drives  arguing all the way  to a deserted and disgusting rest area for the girl to use the bathroom  Harmless enough until she exits and finds her boyfriend missing and realizes she's being stalked by a lame version of  Joy Ride 's Rusty Nail      only driving around in Mater from  Cars   Honestly  if this had been directed written produced acted by anyone else  it might've been fairly good  But no  Because then comes the ghost story  Yup      you guessed it  Plenty of  oh  i'll help you  but wait  you're dead  to  wait is this stalker a person  monster  or ghost    But wait  Who comes to the rescue to save the girl's life and possibly the movie  That one Lawerence brother  Excellent  We're saved   sarcasm  Oh wait  no we're not  You know      if you want to laugh off a pretty bad  or if you get free rentals like I do  give it a try  If anything  you'll learn how NOT to make a movie  -AP3-
