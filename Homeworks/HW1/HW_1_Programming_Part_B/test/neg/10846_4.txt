This film is striking only in its banality and use of cliches  Sadly it was obvious throughout up until the ending  But don't be mistaken into thinking that it ended strongly  Only a little unexpectedly  though nothing worth watching the thing through for  From the taciturn and wronged hero  to the Germanic baddy  to the expendable team  the characters were entirely wooden and obvious  The two FBI agents Smith and Wesson  geddit   gave some hope of humour  but that came to nothing  I am a big science fiction fan but it is hard to find any redeeming quality in this film  A turkey
