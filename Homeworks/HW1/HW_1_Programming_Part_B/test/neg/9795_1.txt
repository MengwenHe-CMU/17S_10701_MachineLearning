Dreadful  A friend of mine  who obviously thought I had an abysmal sense of humour  recommended this  It's bobbins  I almost switched it off  It is only my anal desire to not leave things unfinished that prevented me doing so  This was evidently a British attempt to make a movie with a bunch of also ran TV actors using some lame script from their mate in the business  I struggle to think of anything even approaching the paucity of this movie  Less funny than global warming  I'm not normally so vehement  but I watched this well over ten years ago and thought that I wasted an hour or so of my life on it is destructive  Puerile  plot less  useless tosh  I'd rather eat my feet than watch it again
