Pinocchio's revenge is not a good movie  Nor is it terrible  The acting was wooden at least on Pinocchio's part The puppet had all of 2 expressions As did most of the actors except strangely enough   the secondary characters   most of them were enjoyable over the top  The special effects in this are pretty  B  and as I said earlier the puppet really blew  The 2 best scenes in the movie are the knife through the hand   looked pretty good i think they spent about a 1 3 of the budget on that   and the shower scene   WOW   I think they must have spent the other 2 3rds of the budget on talking the actress who did that scene to do it Outstanding  Seriously this is a slightly below average  b  horror puppet movie   rent Chucky if you have a urge to see puppets kill  The story had a few interesting idea's  enough to keep me watching it to the end
