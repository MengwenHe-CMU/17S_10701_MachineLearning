J Carol Nash and Ralph Morgan star in a movie about a mad scientist in love with a pianist's daughter  When his advances are spurned he injects the father with a disfiguring disease so that she will be forced to come to him to get a cure  God this is awful Its dull and boring and you'll nod off before the pianist gets uglified  I was on the verge  Yea it picks up once things are set in motion but this is one of those old movies better remembered then seen again  If you must see it come in late 4 out of 10
