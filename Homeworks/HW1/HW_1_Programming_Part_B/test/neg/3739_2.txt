I love John's work as a singer  but the movie was dull and 'no worth the time' to view   I thought he did an 'ok' job at acting his part  When he says   your having an affair with the ol' man   to his co-star  I kinda chuckled at his facial movements    or lack thereof   I would suggest the movie if you like John's music but not as a Saturday night video   If you love his music  then the video has a little music from him in it  but not much   So so   at best
