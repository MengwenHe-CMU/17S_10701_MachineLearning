First things first  how can someone with his creativity on the right side believe in a movie like this  I saw this movie and after end of couple of hours was left scratching my head  what exactly is director trying to say  If its a thriller  there are no thrills  if its action  there is no action barring a chase sequence  there is no Drama  and the much touted love story  it actually never takes off  No passion  emotion nothing is there  Actually I never expected wonders from the movie  however after the bumper opening it took  I thought of giving it a chance  I have no problems with Himesh Reshamiya whatsoever  and I am not one of the guys who will bash him at every given opportunity  I went in with an Open mind and came out with a closed one  Let's not put the blame of Himesh Reshamiya  he is just a Debutant Actor  But direction  screenplay  writing  makeup  everything has gone for a toss  Himesh is very stiff and would take a lot of time to come up the curve  He can do the don kind of roles  Hansika is just a kid  and it shows on screen with her baby fat and the way she walks  The only actor who was good was the friend of Himesh in the movie  I don't know his name  but he looks promising  Watch it at your own risk  not even good to watch it for a time pass viewing     Strongly recommend to avoid this Movie
