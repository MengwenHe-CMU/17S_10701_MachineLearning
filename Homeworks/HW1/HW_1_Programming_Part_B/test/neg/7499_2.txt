Am I the only one to think that this is a bad movie  I admit that horror movies often lack things like a big story or good acting or even good special effects  But the way these deficiencies come together in this movie is surprisingly pitiful  Miserable story  The idea of a raped vagina that takes revenge by turning into a man eater sounds quite funny  but what the writer made out of it is stupid  Bad acting  The actors move like marionettes  They play and look like people  who really try hard but completely fail to act  Bad FX  Especially the explosion of the Van looks unspeakably cheap  It is surprising that a director who made some nice movies during his carrier changes over to such messy stuff
