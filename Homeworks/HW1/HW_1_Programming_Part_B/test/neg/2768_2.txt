I couldn't make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir  The plot was confusing  the acting was alright  but the picture quality was awful  Though I bought this at a  Gansters Double Pack   8 movies on two discs  at WalMart for  5 50 and when you put the DVD in  it apologizes for the awful picture quality that some of the movies may have  The plot was flip flopping everywhere I couldn't understand it and had no idea what was going on   then  The End  popped up and the movie was over   What a waste of my time  I say don't waste your money or time on this  Or if you too bought that Gansters Double Pack then just skip over this one    2 10
