A plot that is dumb beyond belief  However  that said  it must be admitted the lead actors go at their roles as though it were Shakespeare  And that is as it should be  It isn't their fault the writer seems to be in a coma  Hats off to what is really a very cunning performance by Joanna Kerns  She proves that just because it isn't on the page doesn't mean a role can't be seized and dug into  And she does so with gusto  Good for her  Ditto to Christine Elise who is called upon to be little more than confused and weepy  but goes way beyond what is asked of her by the script  And to Grant Show as well  A graduate of daytime and prime time soaps  Ryan's Hope  Melrose Place   He is always versatile and underrated  His primary drawback seems to be his impossible-to-ignore good looks  He is a sturdy  well grounded actor capable of much more than he is generally given the opportunity to do  The rest of the cast is basically window dressing  The direction is adequate and the script  as I alluded to  is fairly idiotic  Watch this one to enjoy three good actors in the leads taking delight in performing some much needed scenery chewing  It's fun
