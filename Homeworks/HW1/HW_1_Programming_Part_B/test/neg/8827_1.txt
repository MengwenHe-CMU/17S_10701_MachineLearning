In all the episodes  I never saw any real action or drama or comedy  The plot is so repetitive      Somebody gets something old and then somebody else tells them a little bit about it and how much it's worth and who made it and where it comes from and how much it could sell for and if there was any work done to it  Sowhile I watched about 30 of these  i realized   there is no drama    nobody ever loses a limb or life or gets divorced or hit by a car or air-plane  There are no car chases or explosions- not even a horse race with old carriages  All those guns and swords and nobody goes on a violent killing spree   what gives  No pshycos  no axe-murders  no-gun-totting old Englishmen in bad suits   just yap yap yap   you have an old tea set and it came from the country of Germany back in 1602 - blah blah blah    I'm still waiting for somebody with a time machine to go on screen and ask about it  but no   it never comes to be and the only thing that happens is that some stuffy Englishman or woman serves up some crap about something old being sold in Boston or China during the Ming Dynasty - big EFFIN deal  Can't anybody ever kidnap one of the leads and hold them for ransom  Is there no alien spacecraft that will obliterate the entire floor  Who the hell writes this stuff as a series and expects us to stay awake  This is about as entertaining as watching paint dry - only with commentary  There's no sex  there's no comedy or romance  no action  no suspense  no action  no drama  no mystery or martial arts  This show sucks  What ever happened to supermodels wearing thongs and spewing lasers from a futuristic weapon  Antiques Roadshow - More like grab a blanket and pillow and go to sleep show
