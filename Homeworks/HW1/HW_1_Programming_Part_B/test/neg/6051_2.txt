I really thought this would be a good movie  boy   was I mistaken  For a quick summery  B grade acting C grade special effects D grade for the overall movie  Don't get me wrong  the story was pretty good and not kiddish so an adult too ride along with it  the  hero  is good looking so most women will like it  -   not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some blood but the way it is shot    horrible  the special effects- would be better suited for TV- on a kids show  and lastly   send some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class there  Trust me there are much better ways to waste 2 hours  You have been warned
