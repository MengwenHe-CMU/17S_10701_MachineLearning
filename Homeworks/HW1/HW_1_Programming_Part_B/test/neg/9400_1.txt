Yes i really found this film distasteful   I didn't like the Sandra Oh character  she really annoyed me  It is unlikely she would be accepted into rural Italian life due to the fact she is non-white  this was a bit of PC nonsense   the film is also offensive to Italian men  For instance  the one man she  Diane Lane  has an affair is turns out to be a caddish cheat  But guess what  at the end your typically plasticky American brick-head turns up  all cheesy white smile and tan  and she finally finds what she wants all along  a real American man  and now she has colonized another part of the world   In fact  this film is quite racist in its depiction of Italians and the way it subjugates them as either smarmy lotharios or backward peasants   the photography was good but the film and its attitude were trash
