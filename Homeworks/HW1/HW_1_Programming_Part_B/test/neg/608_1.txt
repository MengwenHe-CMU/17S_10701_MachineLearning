This is a lame comedy  Here's why  A man and wife sitcom  Okay  The Husband is a douche bag  The Wife is the Einstein  How original is that   Jerry Stiller is just the same guy on Seinfeld  The gags are lame  No witty one-liners  I have had enough  Stop this now  The Last Word  Stupid  The destruction of the average white guy continues on ABC  The worst part  Kevin James is actually a funny comedian  He just isn't here  Leah Remini is great eye candy  but is unlikeable  Wasted talent is the word  Bad sitcom
