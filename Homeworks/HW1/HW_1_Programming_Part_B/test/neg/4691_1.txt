Not many people remember  The Carey Treatment   and I can't say I blame them  Blake Edwards did this during his lean years  i e  - between  Pink Panther  movies   and for a story of a doctor turned detective  Coburn  working to solve a murder in his hospital  it's actually pretty forgettable  Coburn is dependable as always and O'Neill is beautiful as always but there just seems to be something missing from the proceedings  The story twists and turns aren't very involving and even the climax  which is supposed to be nerve-wracking  is gut-wrenching instead  A missed opportunity altogether  and an unfortunate one at that  since it was based on a Michael Crichton book   Oh well  at least Crichton didn't write a sequel to it  One star   Carey  on  Coburn
