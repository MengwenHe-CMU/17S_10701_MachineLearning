How could a film dealing with illegal Mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull  Well   Border Incident  is  No wonder that song and dance man George Murphy's career ended not long after this terrible film came out  Politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film  The film stereotypes the typical Mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dull  The film only picks up in intensity once the identities of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the U S  and Mexico respectively  Disappointing at best  we see similar problems in our very own society today
