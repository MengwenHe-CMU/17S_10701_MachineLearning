I saw the first House of the Dead and expected a root canal to be more pleasant to attend  so when it wasn't as bad as that  I was delightfully surprised  Unfortunately  I then got my hopes up that the second one might be okay as well   and I was wrong  Apparently I'm one of the few people who saw this movie that thinks it was bad  I don't know whether to watch it again and force myself to see whatever all the people who gave it good reviews saw  or wonder if I saw the wrong movie  Ed Quinn as Ellis and Emmanuelle Vaugier as Alexandra 'Nightingale' Morgan did a great job in roles that were way beneath them  They deserve to be in better movies  The special effects were okay and some of the characters likable hate-able and that made for a tolerable watch  but for the most part  this movie was just a waste of time  Oh and I have to ask this because I found myself asking it aloud ALL the way through the movie   did anyone not know how to close doors behind themselves so zombies wouldn't just wander into the rooms  Only once did it happen   zombies wandering in  and I found that a little convenient   soldiers walk into a room  leave the door wide open  pay little to no attention to same said door so the zombies can just walk in if they feel like it  with the hapless  livings  being cornered with no way to escape  and yet only once did zombies follow them in  Nitpicky  Maybe but honestly   if I was fighting for my life  the last thing I'd do would be to walk into a room and leave the door wide open so zombies could swarm in and eat me  That is really the only thing  bothered  me throughout the movie  and just the movie for the most part was a bad sequel to a not totally abominable original
