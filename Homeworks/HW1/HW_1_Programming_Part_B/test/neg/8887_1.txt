The chupacabra  according to this mockumentary  is a mysterious creature that has been killing and eating Hispanic goats in Latin America and Mexico for years  One has crossed the border into southern Texas  and a cute  intrepid cryptozoologist  no  I did not make up that word  go to an isolated ranch to find one  Her uncle was killed by the creature  and some grainy video footage of the monster exists  She takes a badass black guy with a gun and two cameramen  for easy-to-edit coverage   and they go ahuntin' for chupacabras  Ten minutes into the film  they find it  The rest of the film has the team of documentarians getting attacked by the bloodthirsty monster  and stilted dialogue  At one point  the team runs into a couple of hottie witches who lead them to the chupacabra's nest   for  100  If only the FBI knew about how cheaply Tex-Mex witches could be bought as informants  Whole decades of mythical beast reports could be cleared up with a blank check  In the end  after the bloody deaths of characters you don't give a goat's patoot about  a chupacabra is captured  killed  and autopsied  The only point of the autopsy scene is to highlight the makeup department's efforts in such a cheap film  The film is shot on video  just like  BWP   yet the cameraman characters never reload their tapes or recharge their camera batteries  The lead actress here is awful  The beauty of the average  BWP  was its use of improvisation during the production  Here  all the lines are written  and are delivered like a poorly rehearsed Christmas pageant  The film is tinged with racism  as well  The only African-American here is a loudmouthed gun nut  At one point  as the crew breaks into an abandoned house  they find a trio of illegal immigrants who comically ask them if they are from the INS  Chortle  chortle  The monster itself is a guy in a rubber suit  and nothing more  For such a lumbering and awkward beast  he is able to sneak up on the cast pretty quietly  whether they have idiotically locked themselves in a giant cage as bait  or cannot seem to get their only vehicle started  The gore is gruesome  but when surrounded by this kind of stupidity  it loses all of its effectiveness  I do not know if this was shot before or after  BWP   but I can honestly say this is the worst film ever made in southern Texas about a mythical beast  Pray there are not any sequels  I will start a letter writing campaign to Troma  This is rated  R  for strong physical violence  gun violence  strong gore  and profanity
