To truly appreciate this film you had to be there  acting   or have been a crew member  Yes  I am  Selena   and at the ripe old age of 42  have serious doubts about what we were doing did  It all started out to be like a  John Waters  type thing  friends acting badly in bad films  Somewhere along the line the fun discontinued  people who were supposed to be friends didn't speak anymore  and BAD became worse  I regret the bad image I might have projected  Try to fit in size one gold spandex pants   Other than that  the film SUCKS so badly  I would not even make my mama watch it  To my director  cast and crew I say   Why can't we just all get along   It's been OVER TWENTY YEARS  PEOPLE
