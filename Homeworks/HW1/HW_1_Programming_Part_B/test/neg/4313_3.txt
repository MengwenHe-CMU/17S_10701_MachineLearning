I have read the other user comments and I am happy someone has compared it to the original by Kamal called Perumarzhakalam released in 2004  The original had a tight story and no loopholes as described above about the Indian Govt not having proper records  or even bad shoots and bloopers  The story is great and a touchy one and well described by others  But sadly Nagesh taking credit for it as his own story is a sad thing and amounts to nothing other than plagiarism  I guess he has been affected by Bollywood's so called  inspired  syndrome  He must at least give credit where it is due  I liked some of his older movies  but now I suspect if any of them were originals after all  Here is a link in IMDb for the original masterpiece  http   www imdb com title tt0425350  comment I recommend everyone to see the original  even with subtitles if needed  to know what class direction and class acting is all about
