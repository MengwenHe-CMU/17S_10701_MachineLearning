The Good Carrey is good actor and he proved it in  Man on the Moon  and in  Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind   But hey  what can an actor do without good story and proper directing  He can do  Number 23   The Bad  Joel Schumacher is poor  overrated director and he proved it in almost every movie he made  What he did with Batman is just disaster  but probably Batman movies supposed to look good  Well  they didn't  Instead of Gothic and macabre we got Disneyland  Sure  Falling Down  was great but can You ruin the film with Robert Duvall and Michael Douglas AND with excellent script  No You can't   And so good actor and poor director finally met and made  Number 23     The Ugly  23  I know that it's stupid to begin with but    Fingerling's subplot  almost half of this movie  looks exactly like intro to another chapter of Max Payne2  VoiceOvers  quality of detective story itself  quality of the characters  even colors  mood and music  editing  and sound mix too  Perhaps it works for the game  but surely it doesn't in the cinema  Mise en scene is so bad that it becomes funny  It's not even annoying  Carrey reads walking down the stairs in park  Why  Is it natural  No  but it looks good  Why Suicide Blond covered walls in her apartment with white paper  If she just wanted to kill herself  There is no logic in that  but still it looks good  Guess what it  it doesn't look good at all  It looks unnatural instead   All female characters are Flat  Why is that so  Who cares  let's go on with the story  Who is this Fingerling  Private eye on the suicide  Hardly believable  Scenes when Walter Sparrow is arguing with his wife about weather book is really about him could be the best part of this movie  Instead we get Moulder Scully routine  Disappointment   Interiors has no sign of people living in them  except the significant objects  shoes  photos etc   Hard luck  Dialogs ain't that bad  But what about V O   Well that's another story   There's no such thing as destiny  There are only different choices   Captain obvious to the rescue   Number was coming after Fingerling  And now it was coming after me   Clich    And so on  It's obvious that average housewife would break into public building in the middle of the night  Successfully and undisturbed  The subplot of the dog dragging main character to the graveyard  This is so old trick and so comfortable for writer  and that it should have been banned  I mean it  Flashbacks and editing similar to  what happened in last episode of X-files  isn't the best way to present the most interesting part of the movie  Is it  I wish I could say that this story deserves a better fate  but it doesn't  It makes no sense  Told in chronological order is weak and unbelievable  All the time we have undeveloped characters trapped is chain of situations which are nothing but badly written fiction  This could be fun  but - since whole movie is dead serious - it isn't  To many coincidences is just bad for every story  And the  mystery   It's predictable and easy to guess   Losing touch with reality is great theme for good movie  but I never saw any of that in Hollywood's productions  If You're interested in the subject just watch  Repulsion  by Polanski or something by David Cronenberg   Spider  or  A History Of Violence  both of that movies deals with similar problems that  Number 23  wanted to show  Wanted  but failed
