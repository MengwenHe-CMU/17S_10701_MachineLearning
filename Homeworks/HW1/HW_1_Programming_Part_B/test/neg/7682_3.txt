Sorry folks  I love Ray Bolger's work but the one thing he ain't is a leading man  Maybe if you pretend he's the last man on earth  this romantic plot might work but come'on now   Here's a movie that exists simply to showcase the title song which was a big hit for the Basie Band the year before  1951   And some pretty nifty singing and dancing save it from being a total disaster   However  the story line is pathetic  even by 1952 musical comedy standards  And the other songs are equally as forgettable as Evening In Paris cologne  The dialogue embarrasses the stars  Day   Bolger  Only Claude Dauphin's Boyeresque charms keep his character three dimensional  So  how to enjoy this movie on video    A   Fast forward through all the dialogue    B   Surrender yourself to Doris Day's vocals and Ray Bolger's loose-limbed footwork  And don't miss Dauphin's hilarious take on a rain-soaked  windswept reprise of  April In Paris     C   Finally  keep a couple of bottles of Cabernet chilled and handy  Bob Raymond
