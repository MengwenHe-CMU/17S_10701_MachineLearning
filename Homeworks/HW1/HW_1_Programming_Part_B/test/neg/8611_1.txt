This movie is really bad  The hero can't play  You see too much that he learned his walking moves by heart  And believe me  he walks a lot  For 45 min  nothing happens  He only walks to places and gets out      Like if the story was so short that they had to extend it by adding useless and boring  looks-like-a-suspens  scenes  Dialogues are very poor  I counted around a lots of  hello's  and few  hang on  on the 1st part  Blood is orange like the Mercurochrome you put on kid's blisters  And scenes are not following themselves  A bloody neck on a scene  a clean neck on the following  The story could have been improved  Yeah I mean what the hell is the story   Martial arts  Where  Is that martial arts  Watch how hesitant and slow are the moves      If giving a kick and receiving a punch is called martial arts  then I am Bruce Lee     The only good point I have found is on fight scenes   They don't play with zoom and fast switching scenes that gives you headache in most of action movies  There are plenty of low budget movies that are great  That one was just to make money  Nothing else
