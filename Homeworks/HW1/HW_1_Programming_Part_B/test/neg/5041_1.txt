there is only way to describe this movie  so bad its hilarious  the acting is so bad i laughed my ass off throughout  The male lead in this movie trying to use a gun is so ridiculous you would think he was trying to copy a toy action figure  i know this sounds ridiculous but when you see it for yourself you can't help but agree  the monster looks like a cgi guy trying to recreate the clay monsters you get in old Sinbad movies  in short this movie is good for only one thing a really large laugh at how bad movies can get  If you want to see bad acting bad script and special effects gone wrong THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU
