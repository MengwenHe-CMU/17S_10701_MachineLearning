Sappy  I liked how they went to the  Haaavaad baaa  to quote books at each other to impress the ugliest girl there  Probably the janitor at my school is a genius too but is waiting to land that big construction job  Just because you keep your nose to the grindstone is no reason to try to cut a steak with it   Do you like apples   the guy nods or something   Well  how'd ya like DEM APPLES   Wow  that IS genius  Duh  Minnie Driver would give her number to anybody  Robin Williams can't paint and keeps the good books on the top shelf  And there's a professor who always wears a priest scarf for no reason
