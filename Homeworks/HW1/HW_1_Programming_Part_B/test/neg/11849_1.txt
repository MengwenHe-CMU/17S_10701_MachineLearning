           SPOILER ALERT                If you happen to like JURASSIC PARK 1  2  or 3  If you happen to appreciate really bad movies for their sheer entertainment value if not for their quality  case in point-John Carpenter's DARK STAR-highly recommended  If you happen to like movies about dinosaurs in general- THEN STAY AWAY FROM THIS CINEMATIC CRAPSTERPIECE  The shameless use of stock footage from CARNOSAUR 1   2 make up most of this miserable attempt at a dino slasher flick- Take the scene  for instance  where the security guard meets his doom at the jaws of the Alpha T-Rex  For some reason  he drops about 50 pounds and appears 10 years younger  Why is that  Simply because this scene was lifted directly from CARNOSAUR  which was a crummy flick to begin with  The ending was a carbon copy of CARNOSAUR 2  for those unfortunate enough to have sat through that straight-to-video loser  Again  we see Mr  Rex do battle against a bulldozer-which alternates as a forklift truck-through the miracle of -ta-daa - stock footage from the aforementioned CARNOSAUR 1   2  Of course  the ending is exactly the same-the beast falls to his death just as the complex goes up in flames  A real insult to anyone's intelligence  But it's still better than watching the ROSIE O' DONNEL SHOW  Rating  1 2  out of
