This one features an interesting way of handling a camera  espercially for a DTV movie - the version I saw was full-screen - but it falls short on the scenario department  First you get around 20mn of talk  talk  talk in a would-be-hip  post- Trainspotting  way  then it's slasher city  And then comes the most dishonest cheat ending I've seen  much worse than  April Fool's Day  - where at least it made sense  So  all in all  it's the old song and dance   interesting director tries hard  but deserves better movie  Funny   usually  it is the actors which are in desperate need of something better   Skip it anyway  for your time
