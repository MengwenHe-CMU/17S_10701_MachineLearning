Well  this movie shows us that Mark Griffiths and producers think we all are idiots  If not how should we understand this  American pilots take off on Mig-29s  Suddenly all aircrafts turn to F-16s  Ha  a magic  After an action    Migs land  The magic again  Oh  did I mention that F-16s had Israel markings   Another magic  obviously unarmed L-39 trainers are bombing enemies  And more magic  while all movie is situated in Europe  we can see a desert in almost any flying scene  Maybe the director wasted all his magic on things above  because action scenes are incredibly chaotic and also explosions look awfully as if pilots bombarded with molotovs  OK  OK  this is a movie  I should write about its story    wait  A story  Yes there is SOME story in this film  And its horrible as well
