 D O A   is a non-thrilling thriller from directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel  The acting is okay and the screenplay is pretty bad  This movie also has some moments which will make you laugh at how stupid the scenes of violence are  For example  someone is shot near a window  We then see from outside the building what looks like that person jumped  I laughed my head off when this happened  This movie tries hard  but ultimately fails  Only watch this movie when you have no other choice  My Critique     Rating   R  Rating Reasons  Violence and language    There was no rating reason available due to its age
