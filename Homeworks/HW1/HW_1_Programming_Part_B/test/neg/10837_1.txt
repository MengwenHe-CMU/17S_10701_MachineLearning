Possibly the worst movie I have ever seen  Pathetic in almost every way  I threw the DVD straight in the bin - I didn't even think it was fair to give it to the local thrift shop  The effects are beyond a joke  The dam control room looks like cardboard  The water looks way out of scale with the backgrounds - nothing works  Then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a Scooby Doo cartoon  I couldn't wait for them all to drown
