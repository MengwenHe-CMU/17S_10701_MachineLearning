I was looking forward to this flick  Being an old Robert E Howard fan  mainly from a Conan stand-point   I was not expecting a great deal and thought they could not mess it up too much     Oh dear - how wrong was I     The main flaw was it was fairly dull  It needed to zip along with a nice helping of supernatural goings-on  sword-fights and the like  You got some gore  but everything else was just pretty life-less  The middle section just seemed to involve 40 minutes in a muddy forest with slow plodding horse-drawn carts and even slower dialogue and character development  On the plus side   Costumes and effects were fine  but not enough to keep your interest  I think it would have been better to tone down the gore  up the tempo  and go for a 12A rating  As a Ten Year old boy  I may have liked this movie  Probably about the age I was first reading the Conan stories funny enough  Perhaps that says a lot about my anticipation of the film  Or        Go really  Art-House  with tone  direction  etc  But that's fairly high-risk as far as Box Office is concerned  Oh well     Perhaps the next Conan movie will make up for it
