If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974  this is the movie for you  But you'll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins  too  see my remarks on My Girl 1 for the reference   Indulgent admission  I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance  having just viewed its predecessor  But as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother  My Girl 2 made me look  with its theme of searching for mother  Put another way  anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with My Girl 2  but relating to a protagonist who asks  like so many adoptees   who's my mama   And if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe  I'll be sure to make my own movie about it  People are listless  Movies should not be listless  My Girl 2  like My Girl 1  is just   listless  Avoid unless you're a complete sap who's comforted by a series of small annoyances
