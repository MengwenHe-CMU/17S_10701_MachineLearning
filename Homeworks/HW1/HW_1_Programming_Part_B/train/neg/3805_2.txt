Err   this movie sucked  A LOT  I have been reading some of the other reviews  Apparently there are a lot of people that think that anything Woody Allen writes or stars in is automatically good    I have watched several of his films  in the vain hope that I'm missing something  But no  they just suck  Poorly written trash  The characters are all very stereotypical  not to mention rather stupid   The plot is   I think it is supposed to be mysterious  Not sure on that  Mr  Allen's character is   Woody Allen  on any other film you have seen of his  If you are a fan of Woody Allen  go see this film  If you are under 50  don't bother   If you are a fan of Woody Allen AND you are under 50   well  you are atypical  I don't know what to say
