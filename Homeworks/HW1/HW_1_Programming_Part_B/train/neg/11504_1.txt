AKA  Mondays In The Sun I have no idea what I just watched  Three men wander aimlessly and drink  grousing about everything and at everyone in their path  This is supposed to be a drama  but what it is  is a total waste of film  without a single redeeming quality  I have read reviews touting the performances herein as  wonderful    beautiful   and  heroic   I'm afraid I cannot agree  unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto-humans who ever walked  All in all  This was not a movie  It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience  I've watched this three times  and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage  There is nothing profound here  whatsoever  It's crap  It rates a ZERO 10 from    the Fiend
