Spoilers of both this and The Matrix follow  I liked the original Matrix a great deal  It was not a deep movie  despite Fishburne's attempts to philosophize  but it was fairly well paced  fun  and I have a soft spot for Hong Kong fights  In the original  Neo was the secret life of the rather unhappy cube worker Anderson  By day  corporate drone  and by night  brave hacker  Eventually  he eventually is forced to choose between these lives by his actions - does he become an outlaw fighting the machine  or does he go back to the safe  forgettable world he started in  Interestingly  he discovers that once one is shorn of illusions  life rather sucks  He has his girl by his side and his boon companions  but he eats processed swill  dresses in sweats  and lives in a truly skungy bit of machinery  Still  the truth makes him free  At least part of the fun of that first movie lay in the  what if it were me  questions raised in the viewer's mind  What if _I_ were capable of the impossible  What if I were  The One   It does not even matter that much what you are The One example of  with a cool title like that  Further  agent Smith made a wonderful bad guy  as he embodied all of the fear of authority that we carry with us  He was as unstoppable as a terminator  and as merciless  At the end of the Matrix  Neo must return to the Matrix to share his good news of freedom  This movie fails to completely to carry through on the ideas of the original movie  and it does so with such lack of gusto  such poor scriptwriting and such poor editing that I cannot believe they had planned these changes  When the dialog is at a fifth grade level  with various long words dropped in randomly  I find it hard to believe that they understand what they are saying  My short list of characterization failures  The Oracle goes from mildly helpful  if deceitful to utterly obstructionist without any real reason  Major  personalities  of the matrix are introduced without need - the keymaster  for example  was a cute idea  but just not that interesting a character  Fishburne loses his  advisor  role  and gets nothing to replace it with  The people of Zion are not particularly likable  nor would you really _want_ them running the world  Special effects problems  The fight scenes are pointless and intermitable  In The Matrix  you felt Neo could lose  and that he had to become something greater in order to survive  In The Matrix Reloaded  he is merely the viewpoint character of a particularly poorly plotted video game  The fight on the freeway looked quite fake  and not that interesting  Pacing problems  As I mentioned above  the fight scenes were interminable  The rave went on too long - everyone in my row at the theater was looking at their watch  Not because we mind good dancing and good orgies  but because we did not know about the people pictured  nor did we care  Whatever hack wrote the creator's soliloquy should be blacklisted from the business  It meandered  used words that the scriptwriter clearly did not understand  and was a waste of time and a pacing killer  The creator's speech could have been done in a tenth the time  and with more peril as  Zion exists to give rebels a place to go so they do not destroy the Matrix  There are now too many people who do not believe  the matrix is in danger of crashing and killing every person hooked up to it  Further  the earth cannot support even the people in Zion  let alone these others  You may choose one person from Zion to form the new Zion  while I wipe the memories of the people currently in the Matrix   Instead  we got a long  drawn out bunch of twaddle  If someone argues that it is deep  ask for a transcript  and try breaking down the sentences  Each one is too long by several clauses  and uses words with clearer  shorter synonyms  So  in summary  not worth seeing  I have seen the third one  and despite what a number of reviewers have said  skip it  It does not save this turkey  The reviewers who feel that the second and third movies were  deep  should go see some truly deep movies  Perhaps read a book or two on rhetoric and debate  and perhaps a bit of philosophy  This movie is just not hard to understand  but it is hard to stomach  Scott
