While William Shater can always make me smile in anything he appears in   and I especially love him as Denny Crane in Boston Legal   well  this show is all about glitz and dancing girls and screaming and jumping up and down  It has none of the intelligence of Millionaire  none of the flair of Deal or No Deal  This show is all about dancing and stupid things to fill in the time  I watched it of course just to check it out  I did watch it for over 45 minutes  then I had to turn it off  The best part of it was William Shatner dancing on the stage  He is a hoot    unfortunately  this show WILL NOT MAKE IT  That's a given
