I have seen and liked the original film  and expected more from a remake than this  GOOD  Effects and makeup are good  No complaints about the score and visuals  they are adequate  and the performances were okay  Tim Roth was excellent  the other principals were fine  and a handful of the  supporting supporting actors  did very well with extremely limited roles   The action scenes were exciting and fun  BAD  The escape from the ape city was terrible  The characters are going in circles  then suddenly someplace in the middle of town there are tunnels to escape  Plus  what escape route leads through everybody's bedroom  The story was pared down to include as much action as possible  I like action scenes but the original film had more meat to it and deserved more respect  Finally  the ending was completely nonsensical as presented  Without seeing the inevitable sequel  there is no justification for it
