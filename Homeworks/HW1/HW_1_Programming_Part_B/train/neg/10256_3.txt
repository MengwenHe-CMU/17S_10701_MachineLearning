Your mind will not be satisfied by this no  budget doomsday thriller  but  pray  who's will  A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people  Small _apocalyptically themed outing  END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies  And it's not only that  but EOTW plays like a hybrid  not only doomsday but convent creeps as well  The villain of the movie is a well  known character actor  This wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of convent  exploitation  that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated  Anyway  the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco  Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World  but the End of the World is not at all his pride
