The orders fatal flaw-besides an asinine plot-is that the character's simply don't resonate or even react  Two examples  A priest  walking through a graveyard late at night  is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits  After fighting them off  he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up   Anything wrong   His buddy asks  having seen the attack   Just some demonic spirits-nothing I couldn't handle   No reaction  no surprise  just like he'd changed a tire  His buddy is equally unconcerned    must be standard priest training      And then you put the wafer into their mouths  Any questions  Ok  moving on  Demon Spirit attacks      Example two  At one point the priests need an answer to a question  and only a demon  or something  who cared by now  could provide it  How  Why  you have to ask a dying man  So the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing  gasping man   Hey  don't kill him   or maybe  That's not nice   would have been more realistic then their response  They never ask that they let the man go or stop-in fact  the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance  They ask their question and go  I had to shut it off at that point-my brain was starting to atrophy  Avoid           one star out of four
