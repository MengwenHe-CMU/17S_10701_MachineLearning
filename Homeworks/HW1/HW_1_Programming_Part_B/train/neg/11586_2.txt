A Nightmare on Elm Street  The Dream Child This is a bad movie  There's no escaping it  I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies  But even being a fan I can't help but see this movie is mediocre  There's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters  By now they had just given up  They don't even try  They are the production of course  hoping for a few more easy dollars  The story doesn't grab your attention  Its so simple it's almost absent  Alice  a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant  Freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams  At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice must find his mother  And that's it   The story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting  In fact that's the only scary thing  the acting  since the deaths are not even slightly cool   The characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them  The girls are as unattractive as possible  The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group  I've seen better actors in school plays  It's embarrassing really  Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this  She is beautiful  sexy and has some talent  But the material just didn't let her shine  What a pity  Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin  s brilliant direction in Dream Master  He tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension Harlin and Craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found  The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel  It's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name   The end for the once scary Freddy  It's too sad to see him now  A clown that's not funny  A bad joke  Goodbye Freddy
