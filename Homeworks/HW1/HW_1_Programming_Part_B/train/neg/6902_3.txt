Despite the rave reviews this flick has garnered in New Zealand  any hype surrounding the production is sadly undeserved  Apart from a clich  s-only plot  the movie is let down by some weak acting  accents  and overall lack of tension  Whilst having the overall look of a big budget  for NZ   the feel is decidedly small-town Kiwi    Has anyone not seen The Brothers      http   imdb com title tt0250274    Those who have will pick the similarities straightaway    I've heard comments that scenes like the boys playing basketball etc were shot to poke fun at the clich  d  boys talking crap   but it comes across as forced    I believe Oscar Keightley sees himself as deeply ironic  but again his delivery always seems merely vaguely self conscious  Those who have any doubts left at all that Samoans-living-in-NZ culture has been deeply   hopefully not permanently  affected by American speech   culture  and everything inbetween will certainly have their minds made up at the end of this movie  Robbie magasiva always looks good on screen   but is let down by the script   It always rubs me up the wrong way when a  comedy  has scenes that are set up in such an obvious way  you are left feeling like having a good groan at the clich  d punchline - see the wanna be white boy    I know someone who found this movie hilarious -however  that person has the brains of a tadpole  and would struggle to spell her name if offered a million dollars     That kinda sums up the mentality of this flick   OK but not great   fun but not funny     Wake up NZ - this is NOT a 5 star movie despite all the glowing  middle class white guilt     -    reviews     My advice   if you watch it  get drunk first
