Where to begin  How about with the erroneous synopsis    X-Men Origins  Wolverine tells the story of Wolverine's epically violent and romantic past  his complex relationship with Victor Creed  and the ominous Weapon X program   His epically violent past turns out to exceptionally non-violent  His relationship with Creed is so glossed over it's difficult to understand how they have any connection at all  We are thrown from one point in the opening scene that shows them as children on the run  to a montage of war scenes that they have fought in throughout their long lifespan  and finally to the present where they are a part of a hardcore government team of assassins  There is nothing by way of showing their relationship as brothers at all  Nothing complex is laid down for us to believe is authentic or even loving   The romantic element of the movie between Silverfox and Wolverine was forced and abrupt  We are thrown into a romance so fast that it's over before you can blink an eye  Having just introduced the character  Silverfox is killed off roughly fifteen minutes later  We are left wondering why we should care about this  Who was she anyway  For a pivotal element of this weak revenge driven story  the romance is surprisingly unexplored  It was rushed in simply because it was required  Oddly enough  when Wolverine finds that his love is dead he leaves her in the woods to rot as he goes off to find Sabertooth  Being the romantic that he is this was out of character for him yet necessary to serve the plot in pulling off a very predictable surprise  As for the weapon X program  lets just say that after the painfully crippling procedure Wolverine is up and running  Eventually he arrives at the home of a conveniently old yet overwhelmingly loving couple  Surprisingly Ma and Pa Kent aren't alarmed when finding a naked sweaty man in their barn  Is it any wonder what fate awaits them  In the previous films and the comic books  the main reason that Wolverines' amnesia plagued him partly hinged on the fact that he was said to have been viciously evil and coldblooded  Knowing this was the case   did he really want to remember such horrors or keep them hidden and continue his current more positive lifestyle of fighting against the villains of the world alongside his team mates  As hinted to in X2  X-men United when Stryker gives up some of his secrets it is said that Wolverine would be disturbed if he had known of the evil works they committed together  This film sets up the team fairly well only they don't really do much of anything  No disturbing violence  no ruthless actions  they merely harass a few natives in foreign lands for the ten or fifteen minutes they are on screen   It seems that Wolverine wasn't an evil man under Stryker at all  Instead he was constantly trying to put a leash on his brother Sabertooth which consequently WAS the violent agent we all thought Wolverine was  Eventually he just leaves all together  No conflict of duality here at all  Idiotically REMOVING that character conflict of good and evil DULLED the story immensely  They may as well have given him rubber claws  There were a ton of other errors in this film that contradicted the X-Men trilogy  including the introduction of one of the lamest Deus Ex Machinas to ever hit a script  Magic memory-erasing bullets   Really  Apparently they are the only thing to bring down Wolverine  Yet this was apparently forgotten when agent after agent was sent to bring him down with bullets and bombs that would surely not work on him at all  Another problem with this film is that it tried to focus on Wolverine while throwing in a ton of other mutants which did little to nothing at all  Interesting characters were mere window dressing and did nothing for the story  Most were in the film for 5-10 minutes max and yet you find yourself wishing we saw more of them and less of Wolverine  Fred Dukes  the Blob but not the comic version  can punch a launched tank missile with little to no physical damage to him at all  but a simple headbutt from Wolverines metal noggin is enough to daze him  Cyclops optic beams  which instead of being concussive force are now more akin to lasers  can burn through buildings but when fired at Sabertooth directly it simply smashes him into the ground without even damaging his clothes  Adamantium trench coats anyone  The  gravity defying  mutant Gambit  instead of utilizing his signature cards  is made into some sort of crazy acrobat  In one poorly edited scene he is knocked unconscious by Wolverine   then amazingly enough a few minutes later he is on a rooftop running TOWARDS Wolverine  How he regained consciousness  ran away a few blocks  climbed up a building  then ran back to Wolverine and Sabertooth in the middle of a scratching match is a mystery yet to be explained  Some have excused this films weakness by claiming it was made from a comic and therefore should be weak on character and heavy on flash  The idea that this movie being a comic film is flimsy and superficial because of that fact is incorrect  The comic book source material  the REAL origin of Wolverine   is a story worth bringing to the screen  It doesn't sugar coat his past nor treat the reader like mindless CGI junkies  It is a well crafted story and although retold and readjusted over time  began with WEAPON X by Barry Windsor-Smith  A much more intense and exciting story  This FOX film should seriously be forgotten   Anyone have that magic gun  4 10
