I've given 'K  h   jik  ' a low score not because it was a bad movie  but because it doesn't do anything worth praising  I've not seen any of Hsiao-hsien Hou's work before  but for the uninitiated  me included  'K  h   jik  ' is advertised as a homage to Yasujiro Ozu   A Japanese director whose last film was way  way in 1962  The film is an extremely sparse work   containing very little dialogue  story  music or emotion  Yo Hitoto plays 'Yoko' a jobless  wandering character who spends her time in her local coffee shop or loosely investigating a Taiwanese composer she likes  Tadanobu Asano plays her friend  who works in a cd shop and occasionally indulges his otaku interest in trains  And that's about all it  We watch as Yoko drinks coffee alone   walks around   waits for a train   catches a train   falls asleep on the train  The kind of mundane reality anybody in Japan can see on a daily basis  Hou captures these ordinary moments of these characters life  but without any meaning to these vignettes it's an entirely pointless film to make or watch
