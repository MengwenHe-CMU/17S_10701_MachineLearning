Considering that I felt like picking up a new Jet Li film to see some but kicking and brainless hand to hand fighting  I grabbed this title  Unfortunatly  this movie contains more gun battles  ala Chow Yun Fat but nowhere near as good   than Jet Li and company's acrobatic fighting  Thus it was a let down  The faucet fighting was interesting and even funny  considering this was something totaly unexpected in a Jet Li film for me  more on the line of say Jackie Chan  But alas I'd recommend Fist of Legend  Tai Chi Master  or even the Enforcer over this dissapointment  Rating 4 for martial arts Rating 3 for overall movie score
