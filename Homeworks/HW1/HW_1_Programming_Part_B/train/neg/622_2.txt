This movie is so aggrivating  The main character looks like he's 35 and I've seen scrawny beanpoles with more balls than this guy  The plot twists are so predictable its not even worth watching for the humor factor  Also some of the worst dialogue I've heard in 3 years   lets go find a small animal to torture   Ugh     I can't even continue  don't watch this pile of garbage  it was made in 8 days  The one highlight is the drunk dude calling the main character a faggot for drawing pictures  2 out of 10  unwatchable
