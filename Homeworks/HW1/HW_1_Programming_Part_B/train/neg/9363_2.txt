This movie has some fatal flaws in it  how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility is unbelievable  Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr 's office  is just bad writing or bad editing   Very very very predictable movie   I am not sure how this film got made  except it is was filmed in Canada  and probably received a government grant   I must say the person playing Aaron  Cory Monteith  did a good job  Unless you are really bored and there is nothing else to watch on television then I would say it will kill some time  but otherwise  it is a movie no actor would want on their resume
