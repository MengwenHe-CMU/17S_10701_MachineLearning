FLIGHT OF FURY takes the mantle of being the very WORST Steven Seagal flick I've ever seen   Up to now  It's a dreadful bore with no action scenes of any interest  Seagal isn't really trying in this - he's fat and his voice is dubbed once more  The Co-stars fare no better  being a rather sorry load of 3rd raters  The Direction by Keusch is very poor and it comes as no surprise that he's also responsible for another couple of Seagal stinkers  SHADOW MAN   ATTACK FORCE  The screenplay Co-written by Seagal himself is laughably inept  According to IMDb  12M was spent on this boring load of old tosh - If these figures are correct I sense a big tax fiddle as nowhere near that amount was spent  FLIGHT OF FURY is actually a shot for shot remake of the Michael Dudikoff flick BLACK THUNDER - which has to be better than this tripe  This has NO redeeming qualities whatsoever Give it a MISS  1 2   out of
