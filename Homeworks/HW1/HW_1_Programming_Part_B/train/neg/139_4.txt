This movie was rented by a friend  Her choice is normally good  I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie  Although it was a horror movie  Which i don't prefer  But no horror came to mind while watching the movie  It was a dull  not very entertaining movie  The appearance of Denise Richards was again a pleasure for the eye  But that's it  We  the four of us  we're a little bit disappointed  But feel free to see this movie and judge it yourself
