I was looking forward to this ride  and was horribly disappointed  And I am very easily amused at roller coaster and amusement park rides  The roller coaster part was just okay - and that was all of about 30 seconds of a 90 second ride   It was visually dull and poorly executed   It was trying desperately to be like a mixture of the far superior Indiana Jones and Space Mountain rides and Disneyland  and failed in every aspect  It was not thrilling or exciting in the least
