The mood of this movie is pretty good and it captures the feel of the 80's well with some good performances  However       The script is run of the mill with the exception of a couple of comedic moments and comes off as being weird where I expect it was intended to be edgy  The characters are totally over dramatized and unbelievable and full of right wing clich  s that the script writer probably saw watching a panorama documentary on the national front  The biggest problem is this movie has no real story  It ticks all the right  arty  boxes but nothing actually happens and at the end you are left wondering what the point was  Very disappointing
