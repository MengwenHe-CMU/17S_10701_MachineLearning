Did they use their entire budget paying the porno stars or what    Sound effects  background music and the editing in general was so bad you'd think some 12-year-old wanna-be made the film  Most of the acting was good considering the script    the  innocent virgin  played her part really well  The mutants look really cool and this actually could have been a really cool flick with the right brain behind the wheel    but  unfortunately for all involved  that's not the case  Turn Left was made better than this movie and those guys didn't even have any money    Good thing I didn't rent the movie myself
