Really  They spelled it BRAIN in the credits  not BRIAN  OK  they didn't have the budget for a spell checker  All the production money went for great old cars  There are at least two Packards visible here  One is a Darin Convertible  A nice yellow Packard convertible  The scenes of the movie studio show that there was some money spent for costumes and set decorations  Old Cameras  an exterior of Ciro's  street signs and whatever was needed to make a visually pleasing picture was there  Poorly written and directed  My DVD says it runs for 104 minutes  approximately  It was more like 85 minutes  It came to an end without reaching a conclusion  There was a collision but no conclusion  The movie just smashed up against the credits  99 cents for this  I paid 99 cents for this  I could have bought 3 cans of cat food and watched my cat's face as he emoted more excitement  For a few seconds in the Ciro's scene after Darren McGavin gets a phone call  it looked like  maybe    this movie would have a surprise twist that would make for an interesting film  Then it just sat there  The young Latin actor played by Steven Bauer  Tony Montoya  could have had a much bigger part in all that was going on here  This cast could have made a good film  I think if they cut Brian's part and use Steven Bauer in his place and change the script and keep the Packards and lose the band and add a Johnny Otis sound alike band  then they got something  Here Kitty  Kitty    Tom Willett
