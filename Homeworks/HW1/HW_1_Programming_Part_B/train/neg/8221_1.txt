This  film  attempts to follow the genre of low budget  hand-held camera flicks that have proved to be very effective and successful  This one  fails  and HOW  It's amazing how many so called  awards  this piece of garbage has got plastered on the cover      it makes you wonder what these critics were on when they actually submitted this     Words fail to describe just how absolutely appalling this movie really is  Seriously  it's THAT BAD  I watched it in 20 minutes flat  on almost continual fast forward  From rubbish lighting to dreadful directing  grainy visuals to muffled sound  and of course not forgetting the ABYSMAL acting  this was one completely and utterly pathetic piece of so-called film making  It seriously  has NO redeeming qualities - whatsoever  Save your cash and watch a decent low budget horror flick  there are plenty out there - Dead End  The Blair Witch  REC  to name but a few  AVOID this rubbish at all costs  DO NOT waste your money or time on this piece of trash pretending to be an actual film  Take heed of all the other comments  You've been warned
