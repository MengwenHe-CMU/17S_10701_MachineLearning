Where to begin  How best to describe just how awful this movie is    Let's start with the campy hick humor  It isn't very funny  Add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - Meat Loaf is horrible and Deborah Harry is even worse  Pity poor Art Carney  who should have known better than to do this movie  And then there is the plot  A roadie whose life goal is to work an Alice Cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for Alice Cooper  At least they get what they want    And then  just when the movie should end  they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well  I won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie  There are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a  B  movie or perhaps worse  Gailard Sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role  That's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good  If nothing else  the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor  Let's just say this  This is the movie against which all bad movies are compared  And none are worse than Roadie
