Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at times  That's it  folks  The sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or not  These 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness  flared trousers  big hair  Zapata moustaches etc    This one isn't  The script is bad  the acting is bad  the direction is bad  and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally bad  The title  hinting at a sex comedy  is grossly misleading  I heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague
