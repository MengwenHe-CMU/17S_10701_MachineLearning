I found the writing in this movie absolutely terrible  The only thing that saved this movie from me rating it as a 1 out of 10 was Lacy Chabert's performance who I thought played the multiple personalities really well  For me she was definitely the highlight of this movie  Dina Meyer was pretty as always but I found her role pretty bland so I don't think one can say that her acting was great  As for the male lead  Armand Assante  his interpretation of the role reminded me mainly of doctors in cheese 1980s hospital series  All of that I could have lived with  However the terrible  terrible  terrible end solution  the role of the psychic and even the role of psychic were just some of the worst writing I have seen in a long time
