Okay guys  we know why we watch film like  The Invisible Maniac   just look at the cover  man    T and A all over the place  with a lot more T than A   But   shouldn't there be a story to go with it   C'mon   I can hear you say -  this is just girls gettin' naked  Who needs a story     Well  if this were called  The NAKED Maniacs   I wouldn't have a problem  But since these guys are cribbing from  The Invisible Man   they need to have a bit of story hereabouts  you know  to keep your mind busy  However  all they can muster up is how this crazy doctor creates an invisibility serum and  when he cracks  uses it to spy on naked women and ends up killing a lot of teenagers  And when you see the smarmy-looking teenagers he goes after  you'll be grateful  One star  for the T and A  but there's a little too much gore for you skin fans  so proceed with caution  TIDBIT - yes  it's THAT Savannah
