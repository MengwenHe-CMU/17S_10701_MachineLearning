Ah  Lucio Fulci  rest in peace  This infamous Italian is most famous for  Zombie   and the absolutely unwatchable  The Psychic  and  Manhattan Baby   Well  add this to the unwatchable list  The plot  as it were  concerns a nekkid woman who wears a gold mask and a G-string  She wants the power of a young dubbed stud who has a set of magic arrows and a bow  They are magic because they glow  Arrow boy teams up with a guy in a bad wig  and they spend most of the movie rescuing each other from flat action sequences  In the end  the nekkid chick is defeated  but not before taking the mask off and reminding me why I broke up with my high school girlfriend  Fulci bathes every shot in an orange glow and fills the screen with smoke  Nothing like a smoky orange action sequence to make you crave Sunny Delight and a cigarette  The special effects are laughable  In one sequence  our ambiguously gay duo are attacked by dozens of arrows that are obviously pin scratches on the film itself  The majority of the effects budget must have been spent on the Fulci-licious gore  which consists entirely of spurting wounds  Hey  we can all use a good spurting wound once in a while  but when you get into spurting wound overkill  it gets boring  I kept having to play with the brightness setting on my TV anyway just to see what the heck was happening  There is lots of talk of fulfilling omens and prophecies  so let me do a little look into the future   if you find this movie and watch it  you will regret it  The scene on the video box  by Media  does not appear in the film in any context whatsoever   Conquest  is a con job  What MST3K could have done with this  This is rated  R  for strong physical violence  strong gore  female nudity  brief male nudity  and mild sexual content
