argh  this film hurts my head  and not in a good way  maybe it's just my growing hatred for the action genre  but even as a kid when i would swallow tripe like Navy Seals  i still regarded this film with dislike  now i utterly despise it  take one fairly good fast-paced story  keep the title and throw the rest away  instead use some half-assesd future gladiators storyline thats so full of plot holes the whole things in danger of collapsing  why is there a rebel base in the middle of the arena  what about the cameras  why have clearly marked footage of what really happened at bakersfeild in an unguarded room   the whole film screams eighties  from the truley awful score to the goofy shiny costumes  ugh  don't watch this film  i know some people liked it  but some people get off on being peed on and i don't understand them either
