I love Zombie-Movies and I love amateur-productions  And Meat Market 2 starts really promising with a nice homage to Fulci  s Classic  Zombi   So I leaned back and waited to be impressed  Okay  some of the makeups are great for such a no budget movie and some actors  the vampirelady and the cook  really stand out  but else there  s nothing  I didn  t expect a new Romero here but there is not one sequence in the whole movie which has even a little bit of suspense or shock value  The director sure knows how to stage body rippings and interesting eating habits  but now  after two parts  it  s time to learn something more  In MeatMarket2 Gore rhymes with bore - for me that  s not enough - sorry     out of
