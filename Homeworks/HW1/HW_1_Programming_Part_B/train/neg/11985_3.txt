Ever wanted to eat worms  Here's a 'documentary' to show you how  Yeah   The kid eats live worms  And that's about the most interesting part of the movie  This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring  I'm totally in agreement here  The movie just doesn't go anywhere    unless you're fond of worm eating  This is one movie it's almost impossible to write a spoiler for    because nothing much happens  Now on the technical side  They should have given that kid a haircut  Who's he trying to look like anyway   Bozo the Clown  It was almost comical   I almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something  And on top of that  the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry  Should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming  All in all  this movie nearly put me to sleep  And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting  I will admit that the scenery was very impressive  And had there been a decent story to go with it  it might have made a hit  It did seem safe enough for kids to watch  The bear scenes and the 'oddball' eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids  and the brief 'skinny-dipping' scene didn't show anything  I gave this one a very generous 3
