To start with  I have to point out the fact that you're gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour  Yeah  some things happen  but you don't know why or what for  When you finally figure things out you just realize that it's nothing but a twisted soad opera  dealing with mature prostitutes  dead mothers  illegitimate sons    The characters are rather poor and the actors  specially the young ones  don't help that much to make'em look credible  Only Marisa Paredes stands out  but she's a superb actress  no matter if the movie is pure rubbish  The only positive things to say about  Fr  o Sol De Invierno  is that d  butant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions  and he's filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense    Well  maybe the next time     My rate  4 10
