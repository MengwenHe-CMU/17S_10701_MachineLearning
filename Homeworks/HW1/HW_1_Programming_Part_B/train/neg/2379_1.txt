i'll admit  i think Uma Thurman is the most beautiful woman on the planet and have made it a mission to see every movie she has been in  unfortunately that includes the horrible films Batman and robin  The Avengers  and this one  this has to rank as the worst movie i've ever seen   yes it ranks even lower than The Avengers   everyone looks lost in it and it is incoherent beyond belief   even if you think Uma is a goddess like i do  PLEASE PLEASE don't subject yourself to this movie  you'll hate yourself the following morning for it
