this movie had a fairly good sounding plot  but the paste was very slow    very slow indeed  even if someone thinks this is a cult classic  i think that there are a lot better films from that era to be watched  the cinematography is not excellent  but not the worst either  the sounds are OK  lighting OK  i still wouldn't recommend this to anyone else than maybe a film-student  the movie does not contain music  and the horses having sex don't make it a good one either  and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was plain stupid  no winnings here  skip this utter boredom  i've seen worse believe me  but this is just waste of time  and i don't get the good reviews here  especially the high ratings
