Valentine is a horrible movie  This is what I thought of it  Acting  Very bad  Katherine Heigl can not act  The other's weren't much better  Story  The story was okay  but it could have been more developed  This movie had the potential to be a great movie  but it failed  Music  Yes  some of the music was pretty cool  Originality  Not very original  The name  Paige Prescott' Recognize Prescott  Bottom Line  Don't see Valentine  It's a really stupid movie  1 10
