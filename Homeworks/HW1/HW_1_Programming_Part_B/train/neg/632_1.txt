Well  what was fun    except for the fun part  It's my second least favorite so far  I even thought it was worse than 'Lazarus' and 'Ghost in the Machine'  Let's start with the good  The teaser  it was incredibly well done and also emotional  Being the great animal lover that I am  it was fun seeing so many beautiful animals in this episode  But then there's all the bad  and believe me there is a lot of it  Little made sense  so those animals were being abducted by aliens and impregnated  whaaa    the dialog was also pretty awful  There were about one or two quotable lines   and worst of all  having pretty much all those animals die was very unpleasant for me  In the end    what's the point  they all pretty much died  We didn't learn anything  we weren't entertained  and I couldn't even find Sophia's death sad    just very frustrating    star  shame because Season 2 was doing so well
