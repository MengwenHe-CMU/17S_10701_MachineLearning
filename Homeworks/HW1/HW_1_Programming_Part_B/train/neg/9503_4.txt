Also known in a different form as  House of Exorcism   this messy little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value whatsoever  The spare plot involves European tourist Elke Sommer who has a chance run in with Telly Savalas  who looks just like the devil she saw on a fresco in the square  Sommer is given a ride to a mysterious house in the country  where Savalas happens to be butler  There  she is mistaken for a long dead woman  and the real soap opera theatrics begin  The house's blind matriarch's husband had an affair with the dead woman  who was the matriarch's son's fiancee  The couple who gave Sommer the ride  Well  the woman is giving the chauffeur  uh   back seat driving lessons   and the husband knows and does not care  Eventually  most of the cast is killed  Sommer is drugged and raped  escapes  and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty airplane   which must have resembled the empty theaters this thing played in  The alternate version of this   House of Exorcism   has scenes added involving a priest  The VHS copy of this  from Elite Entertainment  is crystal clear and letterboxed  There are  extras  after the end credits  deleted sex and gore scenes  Mario Bava's direction is fast and furious  but his screenplay is awful  There are half baked ideas  abandoned plotlines  and stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing in some sort of forward direction  You have life like dummies for practice funerals  the blind matriarch does not act all that blind  and Savalas is given the same lollipops he had in  Kojak    who haunts ya  baby    The project seems like they had two name stars  then wrote the script quickly  something that happens in Hollywood on a daily occurrence now  Savalas looks completely lost  delivering his lines haltingly  and wishing his character had not died in  The Dirty Dozen   Sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot  but her character is a blank  I use the term  character  loosely  The only thing we know about her is her name  This is a real weird film  and your reaction to it might depend on how heavily you are into Eurohorror  and Kojak  I for one cannot recomment  Lisa and the Devil   This is unrated  and including all the extras at the end of the VHS copy  contains strong physical violence  sexual violence  strong gore  strong female nudity  male nudity  sexual content  and adult situations
