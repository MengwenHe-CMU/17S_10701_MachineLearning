I am completely baffled as to why this film is even liked  let alone held in such high regard  especially by so many critics who are  otherwise  quite sensible  There is one key word which describes this film to its core - irritating  The most easily explained example of this is the director's use - or  more accurately  abuse - of music  In the first half  a really dull reggae tune is played about three times  when once is too often   But in the second half  The Mommas And The Papas  California Dreamin'  is played at least seven times  usually at top volume  Godsakes  whether you liked the song or not beforehand  you'd be thoroughly sick of it by the end  Just think  some people claim to have seen this film four or five times  This means they've listened to California Dreamin either 28 or 35 times      All of this needless hyper-repetition  it contributes nothing to the story  could possibly be excused if the remainder of the film had any lingering merit  or if the story was in any way involving  But it ain't  The only aspect I found likeable was Bridgette Lin's charging around and still playing Asia The Invincible in a raincoat and sunnies  Even this wore off fairly quickly  I'm sure this film's undeserved high reputation will convince many poor suckers to go and see it  I can only warn you - if you've never seen a HK movie before  don't start with this one  If you feel compelled to watch it  avoid at all costs seeing it in a cinema  The fast-forward and mute buttons are essential tools for survival here  You have been warned
