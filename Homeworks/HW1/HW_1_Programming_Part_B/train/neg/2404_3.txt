Man  was I disappointed  1  Adam Arkin is more whiny than Ross Geller from 'Friends'  2  A great cast is wasted  Kenneth Mars  Alan Arkin  Ed McMahon  Pat Morita  Louis Nye  with this amateurish script  3  The movie suffers from horrible pacing  It jumps around through in a jumbled  confusing manner  4  The story doesn't even make sense  Why does he want to break the football streak  What about the stupid violin music  None of it is explained  5  It's not even funny  It's like a bunch of accountants trying to do improv  saying  Lookit me  Lookit me I'm being funny   This was a bad attempt at making another  Love At First Bite   I like Larry Cohen movies  but man he failed here  I couldn't wait for the credits to roll  Horribly disappointed
