Cuba Gooding Jr  is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the U S  President  i'll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for  and this film shows us why  He teams up with a persistent news reporter  Angie Harmon  to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president's death  and so on  blah  blah  blah  Even with a cast of James Woods  Cuba Gooding Jr  Anne Archer and Angie Harmon 'End Game' fails to grab your attention  plain and simple  some of the action is good  the acting isn't all bad and the story although clich  d and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie - WELL IT DOESN'T  The writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that  at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters  4 10 It's Boring  Predictable and Dull
