When I was younger  I liked this show  but now   BLECCH    This show is sappy  badly written  and rarely funny  The three leads were all good actors and funny men  Saget's stand up was a lot better than the stuff this show came up with  as was Coulier a better stand up  and Stamos was a better than average actor   After a while  Stamos wanted off the show because it wanted to do more serious stuff  who could blame him    The show eventually got cancelled when many of the actors demanded more money  Here are a few things that drive me crazy about the show  1  The catch phrases- How many times can one person put up with tiring catch phrases like with 'how rude'  'you got it dude'  'nerdbomber'  'cut it out' and 'have mercy' in a 24 hour time period   2  Kimmy Gibler- the most annoying character ever written for television  3  The writing- stale and cliched as an oreo cookie  There is good cliched writing and bad cliched writing  Full House had bad cliched writing  4  Three men living together in San Francisco- Enough said  5  Unrealistic stuff- Too much to recall  6  Trendy kids- The girls had all the latest mall fashions and you can see posters of trendy recording artists they would be into  Now this show is on Nick   Nite  I would hardly call it a classic  I have nothing bad to say about the people involved since I think many of them are talented in their own right  But this show was just so sugary sweet  I couldn't stand it after a while
