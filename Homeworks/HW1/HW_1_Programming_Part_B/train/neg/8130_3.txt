While exploring some caves with his wife  a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects    Occasionally creepy atmosphere and some decent  though under used  makeup effects don't save this B horror flick from being a sub-par tale of man-becomes-creature  The Bat People aka It Lives By Night suffers from its senseless story that's awkwardly plotted and lackluster in pacing  The plot never seems to go anywhere much and the movie never offers an explanation for what happens  or even a satisfying conclusion for it all  The cast is fairly mediocre in their performances  Still I give the film some points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations  The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is pretty good too  but it doesn't get much of a showcase here  A missed opportunity for sure   Definitely one of the lesser man-creature flicks out there    1 2 out of
