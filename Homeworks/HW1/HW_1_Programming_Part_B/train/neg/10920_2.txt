This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen  I have to disagree with another commenter  who said the special effects were okay  I found them pretty bad  it just wasn't realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story  Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story  The archaeologists are looking for  the set   They do not bother to tell what set  or what is so special about it  That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California  while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt  If you're shooting a movie that takes place in the desert  take the effort to actually go to the desert  The beginning - the ancient ceremony - looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert  The action-level was constant throughout the movie  no ups and downs  no climax  It made the movie look short  and that's certainly a pro for this particular movie
