Jeff Lowell has written   directed 'Over Her Dead Body' poorly  The idea is first of all  is as stale as my jokes and the execution is just a cherry on the cake  Minus Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything appealing in this film  Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance  Paul Rudd looks jaded and least interested  Lake Bell is a complete miscast  She looks manly and delivers a strictly average performance  Jason Biggs is wasted  so is Lindsay Sloane  I expected entertainment more from this film  Sadly  I didn't get entertained
