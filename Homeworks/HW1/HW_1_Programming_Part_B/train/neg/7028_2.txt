Somewhere between the Food Court and Zip's  the mall in this film has an explosives store  This is the only place the title character can purchase the bomb he plants in the mall in the dull finale  A fictional town has a new mall  built on some land that was condemned  Cute Girl  I didn't catch her name  gets a job as a waitress there  She lost her boyfriend in a fire at the site where the mall stands  The villainous mall owner hires the arsonist responsible for the fire as a security guard after his first security guard ends up dead  Rob Estes  eons before  Silk Stalkings   is a photog reporter trying to find a story  He hooks up with Cute Girl  and their mutual  funny  friend Pauly Shore  and try to find out if Eric is still alive  He is  living in the mall basement     and traveling through the air ducts and offing different people who upset his former girlfriend  including the arsonist  Eventually  he kidnaps her and the finale involves the bomb and everyone running from the scene before the big kablooey  Morgan Fairchild is along for the ride as the mayor   yes  she's the mayor  Of course  you probably did not need a plot sketch since the entire story is in the title  Someone named Eric is taking revenge against people as a phantom of a mall  This also means there is no suspense  We know Eric is behind this  but we still have to see Estes and Cute Girl go through the motions of a silly investigation  Watch as Fairchild  who we know has been in cahoots with the mall owner all along  pull a gun on our heroic duo in the middle of a crowded party  yet no one says a word as she leads them to her office  and her eventual death  The fictional town is huge  yet nary a policeman is ever called  everyone relies on mall security for order  Eric has been hiding since the mall was built  but I am not sure where  He seems to live in a basement area  but you would think some construction worker would have found him  He also has furnished his love pad quite well  and found a few outlets  since he has electricity  It might be nicer than your own apartment  Pauly Shore fans  both of you  take note  He tricks a security guard out of his booth by mooning the camera  Yes  stop scanning Celebrity Skin and Playgirl  this is where you get to see a grainy black and white shot of Pauly's south shore  although no weezil  This is just junk  and proof positive that I am down to renting just about anything at the video store to stay in the horror section  This film is not Eric's revenge  it is the film maker's revenge for me being dumb enough to watch it  Here is my revenge  I do not recommend it  That'll show 'em  This is rated  R  for physical violence  some gun violence  gore  some profanity  some female nudity  brief male nudity  and some sexual content
