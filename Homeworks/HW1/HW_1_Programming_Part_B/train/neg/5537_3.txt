What  You were not aware that Scooby-Doo battled zombies  Well  you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by Victor Halperin  who had also directed White Zombie four years earlier  That would probably make it the second zombie film made  No  don't go looking for Dorothy Stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films  and don't even look for any brains being eaten  This is 1936  you know  So  what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talking  You do get to see Dean Jagger  Twelve O'Clock High   and Bela Lugosi's eyes  but that is about it  Zombies in Cambodia  indeed
