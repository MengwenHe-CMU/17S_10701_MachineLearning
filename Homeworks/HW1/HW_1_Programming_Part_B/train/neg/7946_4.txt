one word boring  the young demi looks good  but she's pregnant  - point for that  D  the movie is not scary at all    the first scenes looked little crappy  i could render better clouds with my laptop  and after effects  but that was then    and now is now  some movies do not get old well    this is one of them  not worth renting or buying    get something better instead like the exorcist      next  D oh the drama part in the beginning just and simply suxor  D
