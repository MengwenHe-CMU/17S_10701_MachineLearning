Things I learned from  The List   A decent cinematographer  a hot girl who can act and Malcom McDowell couldn't stop this movie from sucking  Blockbuster won't give you your money back  Even when he reads the script and says  Ugh  Really     Malcom McDowell still tries  Chuck Carrington desperately needs acting classes  Hire a writer  Jesus hates me too and punished me by making me pay   5 50 to see this movie  When making a movie  you don't need an ending  Just leave everything unexplained  unresolved an uninteresting enough so that the audience falls asleep BEFORE the ending  Genius  Any random landlord can cure death just by drawing a cross on a window  So make friends  Your maid can sing you back to life  Chuck Carrington still needs acting classes  Your roommate will hate you and make fun of you if you bring home this movie  Apologies will not be accepted
