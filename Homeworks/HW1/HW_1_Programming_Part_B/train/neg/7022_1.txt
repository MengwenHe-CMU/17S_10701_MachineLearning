In over 70 years of watching movies This has to be one of the very worst comedies ever made  Mel Brooks  Mike Meyers   a few other have made some very bad comedies  this however is the absolute bottom of the barrel  It is unfunny from the very opening to the tacked on scene during the credits  Diane Keaton who I normally like must have needed her paycheck badly  She desperately needs to re-learn her craft  Dax Shepard  I do not know who he is  needs a better director to show him how to act  Liv Tyler is also not up to her role  Mike White needs to find another character he has done this same type person a few times too many  Ken Howard who started out years back as a first rate actor  also not as good as he used to be  There is nothing decent I can say on this attempt at movie comedy  Ratings     out of 4  points 25 out of 100  IMDb 1  out of 10
