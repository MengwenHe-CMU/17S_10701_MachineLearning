The director Sidney J  Furie has created in Hollow Point a post-modern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience   Sidney J  Furie dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of 'plot' and 'characterisation' when you remove the crutches of 'motivation' and 'reason'   The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higher  One and a half stars  P S  Nothing in this movie makes any sense  the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane
