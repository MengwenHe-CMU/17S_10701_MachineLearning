This is an anti-Serb propaganda film made for TV   The Muslims are good  the Orthodox Christian Serbs are BAD    That's the message  Using  entertainment  to get across a propaganda message is nothing new  This movie lays it on thick  And apparently many viewers and reviewer lap it up  I know better  The Serbs  under General Draza Milhalovitch and his Chetniks  saved over 500 shot-down US fliers from the Germans in World War II  Churchill decided to betray Milhalovitch and put British backing behind communist Tito  Roosevelt followed suit and as a result  after the war ended Yugoslavia was delivered over to communist Tito  And US ally Milhalovitch has been smeared by the media ever since  This movie is part of the anti-Serb propaganda campaign engineered by George Soros and his International Crisis Group  ICG  which culminated in the Kosovo  War   in which Serbia was bombed by NATO because of totally false claims by the ICG of  mass graves  in Kosovo filled with  victims  of the nasty Serbs  The fact that there were no such mass graves and the Albanians  Muslims  had no business being in Serbia's Kosovo are facts that most of the media won't print  I chose this movie to watch because the one-sentence description on the video cover looked interesting  Imagine my disgust when I discovered I had been fooled into renting another branch of the propaganda machine aimed at Serbia  Instead of this propaganda someone should make a movie about the unwillingness of the Clinton Administration to come clean with the Congress and with the American people about its complicity in the delivery of weapons from Iran to the Muslim government in Sarajevo  I won't hold my breath waiting for such a movie
