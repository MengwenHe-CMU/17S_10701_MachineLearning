I will never be a member of any club that would have me  especially this one  Starr Andreeff is a single mom stripper who gets attacked by a female vampire and left for dead  She begins to get a hankering for blood  and meets up with John Savage  looking like he's wondering where he left Michael Cimino's phone number  Savage is also a vampire and wants to let Andreef join his little vampire family  which consists of a British vamp  the blonde vamp who attacked Starr  and a green haired midget  I am not making this up   The family does not want Starr  so they try to kill Savage and Starr and Starr's kid  Someone forgot to tell John Savage that this was a drama  He spends most of his screen time exhibiting more facial tics than Hugh Grant on a Jolt Cola bender  and he reads all of his lines like he is making a Farrelly Brothers film  Andreeff tries to make the most of a badly written role  but screenwriter director Ruben goes for all the vampire cliches  like Starr eating her son's pet hamster and buying a lot of raw meat to fight the craving for blood  The kid also gets knocked around a lot  for those who think watching violence against children is really entertaining  The film is extra gory  but not in a wild  over the top way like  Killer Tongue   Here  the gore is gross and never justified  it just occurs  It is just in the budget  Most of the R rating goes to Andreeff's coworkers  who are put through embarassing strip routines in the background of conversation scenes  The budget does not include vampire fangs  All the vampires here must stab their prey to eat  Nifty idea  unless you have already seen George Romero's  Martin   Even at 77 minutes  and once you throw in Ruben's attempts at arty direction  skewed frames  blurred scenes   this is one tiresome  dull  and dirty ride  Leave this club and take a shower  you will need it  This is rated  R  for strong physical violence  gun violence  sexual violence  strong gore  strong profanity  female nudity  sexual references  drug abuse  and adult situations
