Simply put  this is the worst movie since  Police Academy  Mission to Moscow   if you liked that movie you will probably like this one   What were they thinking   Some ideas should stay just that  an idea  The fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense  What was so bad about it I hear you ask  One word     EVERYTHING  Cost to Hire   4 50 Cost in Time to Watch  89 Minutes I want a refund on both
