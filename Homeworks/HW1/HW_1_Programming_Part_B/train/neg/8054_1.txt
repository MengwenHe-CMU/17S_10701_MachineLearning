Oh dear  what a horrid movie  The production was so cheap and nasty    Remember the shot from  the Natural   where the lightning hits the tree  leaving a glowing stump  that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from   Well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house  I wonder if they paid to use the footage from The Natural  or did they just hope that no-one who would watch the film would pick it up   Then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck  Such over-acting in the cabin   A really bad film  a really bad film
