Just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself  Seriously  even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is  although it has to be one of the most hilarious things I have ever seen  Never bothered to post a comment on here before  but this piece of crap really warrants it   Firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical  Brother of the lead character  either Ben or Arthur  I forget which is which  and frankly it's never very clear  wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to Christians  but apparently mass murder isn't  Then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint  This leads to nothing  but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole  film  -  I don't make sense  You don't make sense  That's who makes sense    Brilliant  Then there's the acting  which is just atrocious  It must be seen to be believed  My personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman  who is clearly reading her lines off of something  yet still managing to mess them up  Enough said  The gay couple couldn't be less convincing  There's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy  and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts  Only fatter  And less talented   The  film  has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still  and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing  The whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on  Yep  But anyways  we all know how terrible this thing is  so I'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the  film  provides   - When the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape  Hilarious  - Mildread  No idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her  sometimes they don't  but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless  Hilarious  - The stoned lawyer  Already mentioned her  but she's so funny she's worth another mention  - The evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests  - The evil brother's anti-gay potion  - The evil brother's cats  - The ending  which I won't give away because it MUST be seen to be believed  I warn you though  make sure you're not eating at the time     The tub of lard main character director producer gets naked  It's foul   Basically  Ben and Arthur is indescribably bad  but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time  Literally  nothing is good about this excuse for a film  the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times
