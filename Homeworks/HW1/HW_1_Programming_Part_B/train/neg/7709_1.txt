Never see this movie  It tries to be a spoof on scifi thriller films of the 1950s and 1960s but all it succedes at is making you wish really badly that you were watching one of them and not it  It is very lame  A spoof has to have some aspect which has some above par quality to it  This movie does not have any such aspect  Save yourself  It's too late for me but    just don't watch it
