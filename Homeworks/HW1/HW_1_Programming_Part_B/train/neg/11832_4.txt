From the creators of Shrek           OK  that grabbed my attention  Well the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar  Madagascar was half as good as Shrek  And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar  That means Flushed Away isn't good  The animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn't  The story of this movie was only meant for kids  It's seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick  But there were many jokes meant for adults  I bet kids dint understand the jokes  Despite that I dint like this flick  I am completely disappointed  4 10
