Paul Lukas played a Russian intellectual making his living as a waiter in  Grand Slam   directed by William Dieterle  1933   It is a surprisingly funny satire of the building up of celebrity  The waiter and the Russian restaurant's hat-check girl played by Loretta Young become America's sweethearts as bridge partners who do no squabble  With the aid of publicist and ghost-writer 'Speed' McCann  the wonderfully deadpan Frank McHugh  they become walking advertisements for the  Stanislavsky system   a  system  of bidding whatever one feels like  since bids are not rational  there is no basis for recriminations about their stupidity   A duel with displaced bridge guru Cedric Van Dorn  sounds close to Goren  no  and I suspect the choice of the character's name  Stanislavsky  was also a slam at another kind of system   a puffed-up charlatan played very well by Ferdinand Gottschalk  is broadcast on radio stations across America like a prize-fight by Roscoe Karns  another great fast-talking deadpan comic actor of the 1930s   The bridge players are even in a roped-off square  though the audience is above them  unlike in boxing  rings   The wide variety of American types prefigures the comedies of Preston Sturges  though for manufacturing celebrity   Grand Slam  most calls to mind two better movies from the same  pre-Code  era with Lee Tracy playing fast-talking publicists   The Half-Naked Truth  and  Bombshell   but  Grand Slam  has its moments  especially for anyone who has played bridge with serious point counters  Loretta Young was already a clothes horse   To me  her face seems a bit long and horsey  too  Another era's notion of beauty  I guess     The movie unfortunately all but drops Glenda Farrell  who plays McHugh's forgetful girlfriend
