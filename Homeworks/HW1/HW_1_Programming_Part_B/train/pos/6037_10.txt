What a GREAT British movie  a screaming good laugh and sexy Gary Stretch too  and oh  lots of bikes and lovely Welsh countryside  Members of our club the ARROWHEAD Bike and Trike Social Club appear in it as extras  Hooray    There are some genuinely hilarious bits  good acting  a good idea  Met the director  Jon Ivay at a showing in Wareham  Dorset  A great man  down to earth and a good laugh  This film must be supported  as all great Brit movies should  So please go and see it if you can  they have a website with cinemas that are showing it   so find one near you  I can't wait to get the DVD  Some of our biker friends have seen the film two or three times already and can't get enough of it  Amanda
