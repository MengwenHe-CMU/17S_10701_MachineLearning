Johny To makes here one of his best style exercises  making a strong film with a good Yakuza's story  The election of the new Yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization  In my opinion the violence is wise used in the context  making a very strong gangs film  I specially love the way he tells the history  moving around all the roles inside the Yakuza's family  and making that we see the violence  like the only way they have to solve their problems    Talking about  the technical aspects  the film is a good example of paused  rythmic and planified way of shooting a film  One of the Hong Kong Films of the year  Is like Infernal affairs  but without the easy action-violence scenes  and the confused storyline  Strongly recommended to all Asian films lovers   sorry for my English  better do in Spanish lol
