FATTY DRIVES THE BUS is simply the funniest  most original and entertaining piece of work i have ever had the pleasure of seeing  this movie is by no means up to Hollywood standards  or even that of a straight-to-video movie fluff comedy starring terry  hulk  hogan  in terms of camera work  editing  acting  budget  or anything else  what this movie DOES have though  is a very original and enjoyable story  and it is obviously done by people who love making it  and the enthusiasm of the all the cast and crew really break through all its budget and acting downfalls  this movie proves that you don't need a huge budget or decent actors to make a great film  all you need are some original ideas and some passion for what your doing  simply the best movie ever  i don't care how you get it  rent it  order it  steal it  download it  just see this movie  now i just hope they make a DVD version
