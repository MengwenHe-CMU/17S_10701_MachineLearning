let me say that i love Adam Sandler  watching reign over me i was paying close attention to his acting when he raises his voice  i cant help but think of happy gilmore yelling at a golf ball  then i snap back as Adam Sandler sucks me in Reign over Me is a great film  a film that comes off slow at first with you expecting emotion in every scene Don Cheadle always does a great job and is no exception here with some truly great lines and is worthy of an Oscar in any movie he does adam sandler was amazing in so many ways not only was this his most dramatic best acted film of his career  but i can recall laughing out loud at many parts of this film The supporting cast was great also with Saffron Burroughs and Jada Pinkett Smith I would highly recommend this movie its got tremendous acting beautiful shots of NYC great comedy great drama And a new found respect for Adam sandler if you ever doubted him or a reassurance at how great Don Cheadle is
