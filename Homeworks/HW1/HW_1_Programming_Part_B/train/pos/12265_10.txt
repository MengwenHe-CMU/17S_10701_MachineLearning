 Tintin and I  first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary  The photography and the editing are truly breath-taking  almost anti-Dogma   We follow the life of Tintin drawer Herg   through an open-hearted interview from 1971  The Tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century  In the midst of these Herg   has his own demons to fight with  and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection  Even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from Tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums  the story of Herg   is told entirely through interviews and archive material  and never through reconstructions  Herg   lived the turbulent life of a true  suffering artist  But the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again
