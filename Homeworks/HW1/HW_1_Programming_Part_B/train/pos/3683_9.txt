18 directors had the same task  tell stories of love set in Paris  Naturally  some of them turned out better than others  but the whole mosaic is pretty charming - besides  wouldn't it be boring if all of them had the same vision of love  Here's how I rank the segments  that might change on a second viewing   1   Quartier Latin   by G  rard Depardieu One of the greatest French actors ever directed my favourite segment  featuring the always stunning Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara  Witty and delightful  2   Tour Eiffel   by Sylvain Chomet Cute  visually stunning  thanks to the director of  The Triplets of Belleville   story of a little boy whose parents are mimes  3   Tuileries   by Ethan and Joel Coen The Coen Brothers   Steve Buscemi   Hilarious 4   Parc Monceau   by Alfonso Cuar  n   Y Tu Mam   Tambi  n    Children of Men    feat  Nick Nolte and Ludivine Sagnier  funny   5   Place des F  tes   by Oliver Schmitz  feat  Seydou Boro and Aissa Maiga  touching   6   14th Arrondissement   Alexander Payne's   Election    About Schmidt   wonderful look for the pathetic side of life is present here  feat  the underrated character actress Margo Martindale  Hilary Swank's mother in  Million Dollar Baby   as a lonely  middle-aged American woman on vacation  7   Faubourg Saint-Denis   Tom Tykwer's   Run Lola Run   frantic style works in the story of a young actress  Natalie Portman  and a blind guy  Melchior Beslon  who fall in love  8   P  re-Lachaise   by Wes Craven  feat  Emily Mortimer and Rufus Sewell  plus a curious cameo by Alexander Payne as   Oscar Wilde    9   Loin du 16  me   by Walter Salles and Daniela Thomas  simple but moving story from the talented Brazilian directors  feat  Catalina Sandino Moreno   10   Quartier des Enfants Rouges   by Olivier Assayas   Clean    a sad story feat  the always fantastic Maggie Gyllenhaal  11   Le Marais   by Gus Van Sant  feat  Gaspard Ulliel  Elias McConnell and Marianne Faithful  simple  but funny   12   Quartier de la Madeleine   by Vincenzo Natali  feat  Elijah Wood and Olga Kurylenko  13   Quais de Seine   by Gurinder Chadha  14   Place des Victoires   by Nobuhiro Suwa  feat  Juliette Binoche and Willem Dafoe  15   Bastille   by Isabel Coixet  fabulous director of the underrated  My Life Without Me    feat  Miranda Richardson  Sergio Castellitto  Javier C  mara and Leonor Watling  16   Pigalle   by Richard LaGravenese  feat  Bob Hoskins and Fanny Ardant  17   Montmartre   by and with Bruno Podalyd  s  18   Porte de Choisy   by Christopher Doyle  with Barbet Schroeder  mostly known as the director of  Barfly    Reversal of Fortune  and  Single White Female    I could classify some segments as brilliant and others as average  or even slightly boring   but not a single of them is plain bad  On the whole  I give  Paris  Je t'Aime  an 8 5 10 and recommend it for what it is  a lovely mosaic about love and other things in between
