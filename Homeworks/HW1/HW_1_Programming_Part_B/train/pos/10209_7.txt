 Happenstance  is the most New York-feeling Parisian film I've seen since  When the Cat's Away  Chacun cherche son chat     A film from last year released now to capitalize on the attention Audrey Tatou is getting for  Amelie   its French title is more apt   Le Battement d'ailes du papillon  The Beating of the Butterfly's Wings   as in summarizing chaos theory as a controlling element in our lives  Tatou's gamine-ness is less annoying here because she only occasionally flashes that dazzling smile amidst her hapless adventures  and because she's part of a large  multi-ethnic ensemble  so large that it took me a long time to sort out the characters  especially as some of the cute guys and older women looked alike to me  and some of the characters fantasize what they should do such that I wasn't sure if they were doing that or not   But I loved how urban the coincidences were  from immigrants to love nests to crowded subway cars to hanging around caf  s  The subtitles quite annoyingly gave both parts of a dialog at once   originally written 12 8 2001
