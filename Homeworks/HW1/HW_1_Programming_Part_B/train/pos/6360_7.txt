I have just read the lead comment for this film that is on the front page with the voting results and cast run down  Why is it that some people can not take a film for what it is supposed to be  This film is supposed to be a light hearted  tonge in cheek  family comedy  things to make the kids laugh and things for the adults  and that is exactly what this film does  I laughed my nuts off at this film  I thought Carey put in a great performance and the whole film  if watched at Christmas  really give you a bit of festive cheer So to all of you film reviewers stop trying to sound like film students and knock every film because it is not  Taxi Driver  or  The Godfather  and take films for what they are supposed to be  entertainment
