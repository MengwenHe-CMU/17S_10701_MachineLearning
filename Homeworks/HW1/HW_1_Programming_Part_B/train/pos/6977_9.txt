Im really addicted to Caprica  because it's a really good prequel series to Battlestar Galactica  It really has a slow pace start  but surely to pick up soon after new episodes continue to air  I have heard great things about future episodes and guest stars for the first season  This Sci Fi drama is sure to please us fans who love a mix of both genres  Eric Stoltz does an amazing job  as well as Polly Walker as Clarice Willow   Totally worth checking out   Catch Caprica On Fridays At 9pm 8pm central on SYFY
