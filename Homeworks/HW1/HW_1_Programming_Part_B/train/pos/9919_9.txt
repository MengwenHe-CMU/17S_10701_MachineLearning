Mesmerizing  breathtaking and horrifying  this hauntingly beautiful film is the  Apocalypse Now  without fiction  Slow in pace  quiet in mood  it gives good glimpses of the poisoned patches of Earth that may well be signs of an inevitable doom  There is no doubt in my mind -- the nature is plagued and we are the disease  Greed  the very essence of humanity that drives evolution and progress  has turned us into something like cancer  on its way to consume the host and die with it    Manufactured Landscapes is quite an unforgettable viewing experience - at least I'll never regard my toaster and iron the same way again
