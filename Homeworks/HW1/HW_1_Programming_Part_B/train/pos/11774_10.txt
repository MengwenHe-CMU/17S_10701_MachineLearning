Is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window displays  No  and here's why     In  Hare Conditioned  the sale that Bugs is helping promote is over and the store manager  Nelson  is transferring him to a new department  taxidermy  Naturally  Bugs objects and the fun begins  using nearly every department in the store  children's wear  sports  shoes  costumes  women's nightgowns - don't ask    Bugs comes out on top at every turn  even referring to the manager as  The Great GilderSNEEZE   Even when trapped in the confines of an elevator  Bugs makes the best of the situation  Director Jones is on top of his pictorial game as always  as are Blanc  as Bugs  natch  and Nelson  the manager - who DOES sound like radio mainstay Gildersleeves - go ask your grand-parents   And a sage word of advice  when confronted by a fuzzy-looking woman wanting to try on bathroom slippers  always check her ears  Ten stars for  Hare Conditioner   the best argument yet for animal labor laws
