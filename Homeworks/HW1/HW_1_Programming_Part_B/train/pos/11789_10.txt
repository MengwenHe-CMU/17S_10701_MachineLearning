Hello  this little film is interesting especially for an artist  film-maker or music creator or a visual artist  for  One can feel and examine David's touch style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity  You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots  the pans and the sound elements   Even as simple film  this creation is multy-layer  For example  there are some sounds that drone all along  while others appear  though subtle   at certain points to support certain shots  One can see also several types of pans  some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way  There is diagonal pan  Zooms also go back and forth sometimes  The lightning and the composition disposition of elements in the space is  as usual and obviously  work of a painer artist  This can be felt even in this crappy room  This is to say  one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look view and composing the scene  Then comes the forcelines of the visuals  like digonales  parallels  etc  The light's degrad  es and the colours  although without too much research for textures as in big productions  are fine too  This is an artist's sketch of a sort    All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the David's touch feel to it  as with any true artist
