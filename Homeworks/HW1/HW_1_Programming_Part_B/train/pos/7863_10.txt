This movie is an eye opener for those who can only the glamorous lifestyles of the stars  It tells you how people who would like to do good are not able to  Plus the bomb blast scene is very real  What you read and are taught just does not happen    Can raise your BP level by 10  All actors played their role very well  Some scenes may   could have been avoided to include teenagers  This movie is quite adult in nature  Not a movie that can be seen with family  Casting is great
