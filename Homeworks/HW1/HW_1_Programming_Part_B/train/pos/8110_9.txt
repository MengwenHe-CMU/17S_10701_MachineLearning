Amazing effects for a movie of this time  A primer of the uselessness of war and how war becomes a nurturer of itself  A wonderful thing about this movie is it is now public domain and available at archive org  No charge  no sign up necessary  Watch it in one sitting and you will be propelled  I plan to share this flick with as many people as possible as I had never heard of it before and I am a hard core sci fi fan  I would like to see how others react to this movie  Watch it  Rate it  Tell us what you think
