Cinematically  this film stinks  So does a lot of the acting  But I don't care  If there is a strong representation of what the 80's were like For a lot of us in the innercity anyways  and what hip-hop  Zulu nation  and break dancing were really like Great music  great dancing  It almost seems like a documentary of a time now past when hip-hop was a way of life  It's also interesting to see New York looking like ground zero from a nuclear attack  Some viewers may be too young to remember that It was a poor  run down city during the 70's and 80's  This is the best of all the hip-hop break dancing movies that came out around that period  Of course the 80's are considered a joke now with all the bad tv shows and movies  but those of us who lived through it will always remember it fondly for a time when music  dancing  and graffiti were fresh  yo
