Shintar   Katsu  who played the blind swordsman  Zatoichi  in a total of 27 movies  ends the Hanzo trilogy with this excellent film in which he gets to make love to a ghost  Mako Midori  Blind Beast   The big stick  used often in the pursuit of justice  is retired forever  Katsu was his usual impudent self as he pursued those who would steal from the treasury to lend at usurious amounts to those who could not afford to pay  The usual amazing swordplay and skill of the big guy was present  along with the blood  I'm going to miss him
