The Movie I thought was excellent it was suppose to be about romance with a little suspense in between  Rob Stewart is a wonderful actor I don't know why people keep giving him a bad rap  As for Mel Harris she is a great actress and for those who thinks she looks too old for Rob it's only by five years  Rob had a lead role in his own TV series as well as one on the Scifi channel  I'm sure you remember Topical Heat aka Sweating Bullets and PainKiller Jane  He also starred in a number of TV movies and is now making a TV Mini series  They need to give him more leading roles that is what he is best at
