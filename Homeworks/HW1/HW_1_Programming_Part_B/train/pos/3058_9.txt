I bought this a year or more ago for  2  yep   2   left it on the shelf for ages  now watching DVDs while holed up with a cold  This is a haunting movie  Brilliant performances by all involved  especially the 6yo boy  about the only smiles you get in this movie   Plot reminds me of perhaps my favourite movie ever  Grosse Pointe Blank  but obviously that's lighthearted  this is heavy hearted  As a psychologist  a clinical and forensic psychologist  a shiver went up my spine when the identity of the new contract was revealed  Scary stuff  Brilliant work all round  Pete
