Does anyone know the exact quote about  time and love  by George Ede aka  Father Fitzpatrick in the move  It had to be you  He was talking to Charlie and Annna in the church as they were leaving  If not I will have to rent the movie  This was a great movie  I also loved Serendipity  Great love story for the soul   I met my one true love  my Soulmate  and although I had the experience to meet him when I had least expecting it  I wasn't ready for that kind of emotional relationship   Altho  we did marry  I wasn't mature enough to give as much as I thought I would  I got complacent and took his love for granted and he withstood it for 7 years   He finally left with resentment but we are still hurt and angry   in disbelief about the way it turned out  I had some very hard lessons to learn and we have now been apart 3 years  This movie meant a lot because I am still waiting on reconciling with my one and only true love  I can NOW appreciate that distinct feeling inside of me and the quote of Father Fitzpatrick rang true for me  I know when he has healed enough to trust me again  we will remarry  Don't EVER GET COMPLACENT AND TAKE TRUE LOVE FOR GRANTED  IT HAS BEEN THE HARDEST LESSON OF MY LIFE   Also the music in this movie is OUTSTANDING and MEANINGFUL  This movie is DEEP and spiritually uplifting  TRUE LOVE is worth waiting for  if it is meant to be  it will  no matter what  IT WILL HAPPEN  Nothing is impossible  even when it's the second time around  Thanks
