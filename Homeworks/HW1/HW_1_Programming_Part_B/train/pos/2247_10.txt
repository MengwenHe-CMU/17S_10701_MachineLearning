I'm disappointed at the lack of posts on this surprising and effective little film  Jordi Moll    probably best known for his role as Diego in Ted Demme's  Blow  Writes  directs  and stars  I won't give away any plot points  as the movie  at least for me  was very exciting having not known anything about it   If you have a netflix account  or have access to a video store that would carry it   I highly recommend it  It's a crazy  fun  and sometimes very thought provoking creation  Moll  's direction is  quite  impressive and shows a lot of promise  Unpredictable  with amazing imagery and a great lead performance spoken in beautiful Spanish  No somos nadie   God is on Air  is an amazing film you can show off to your friends  SEE IT
