Mating Game is a charming  wonderful movie from an era gone by  Hollywood needs to consider a charming remake of this movie  My wife and I would go see it  It is an excellent romantic comedy that my wife and I watched on AMC  This movie has Tony Randall at his best  Debbie Reynolds is great  as always   Loved it  We plan on ordering on DVD to add to our growing collection of movies  Too bad Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore  Hey Hollywood    time to dig some of these type of scripts out of the old safe  update them a bit  without spoiling the original movie and script as you have done with other remakes   and hold a casting call  A remake would be a big hit on the silver screen  DVD  and on cable SATTV  SN Austin  TX
