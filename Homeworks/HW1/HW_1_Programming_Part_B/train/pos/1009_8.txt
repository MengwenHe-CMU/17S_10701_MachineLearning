Fact  Stargate SG-1 is a cheesy sci-fi TV series  There's no escaping facts  How much you try to excuse yourself or explain it Stargate SG-1 remains a cheesy sci-fi TV series  Stargate SG-1 does borrow and steal ideas briskly  Special FX aren't nearly as impressive as they could have been and the action isn't going to blow you out of the chair  Or couch for that matter either  But  and this is where I really think Stargate SG-1 deserves all the credit it can get  for each and every episode or stolen idea I think you can count at least one cheesy sci-fi movie that's actually worse than a one hour TV episode  In fact some episodes actually could probably have been 90 minutes long and still have been better than most movies  And being able to keep that quality throughout the show and keep delivering and pushing the storyline further is what makes Stargate SG-1 special  I am very picky with my selections  I follow perhaps one or two TV series at most and I hold pretty high standards which made me even more surprised when I found myself caught  So for those who decide to brush of Stargate SG-1 as yet another tacky sci-fi show  don't  Stick with it and you'll see what I'm talking about
