This is one of the most amazing stories I have ever seen   If this film had been directed by Larry Clark  then this story about a school shooting probably would have been shown through the eyes of the killer and whatever led that person to go insane in the first place  Instead  the plot focuses mainly on the aftermath of a school shooting  and how it effected the victims who survived  I had seen Busy Phillips in other films before  but her performance in this movie is by far  her best  The only other movie that I've seen with Erika Christensen is  Swim Fan  which made me almost not want to watch this film  but she turned in a very good performance herself  This is one of the few movies I have seen that was actually able to make me cry  Trust me when I tell you  that doesn't happen very often  Home Room is a beautiful film  and that's all there is too it
