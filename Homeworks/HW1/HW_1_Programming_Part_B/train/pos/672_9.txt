This motion picture has a steady  haunting pace backed up with great acting  one of Chamberlain's best performances  and a story that is revealed to us over time  Beyond that  the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy  cautious and somber tone  Weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals  their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous  Although they are unrelated in story as well as genre  this maintained the same feeling within me as Ursula Le Guin's  Lathe of Heaven   1980     The Last Wave  is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments  Remember   hacking and slicing  doesn't make a film a horror movie  it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all
