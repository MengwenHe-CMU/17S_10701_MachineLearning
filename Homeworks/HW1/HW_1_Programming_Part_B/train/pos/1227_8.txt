I caught this movie on my local movie channel  and i rather enjoyed watching the film  It has all the elements of a good teen film  and more - this film  aside from dealing with boys-girls relationships and sex and the like  also deals with the issue of steroid use by young people  The film has that real-life feel to it - no loud music  no special effects and no outrageous scenes - which  for this movie  was right  That feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film - some of which we probably know from where we live  Overall  a good movie  fun to watch  8 10
