I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne's  Waitress   2007   This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie  Adrienne was a marvelously talented writer-director  an original and unique artist  She managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency  Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge  Male lead Reg Rodgers  looking like Judd Nelson  is fine  There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen  The song at the end of the movie  The Bastard Song  written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy    It's a world of suffering  In a sea of pain  No matter how much sun you bring  You're pummeled by the rain    Don't let the heartless get you down  Don't greet the heartless at your door  Don't live among the heartless
