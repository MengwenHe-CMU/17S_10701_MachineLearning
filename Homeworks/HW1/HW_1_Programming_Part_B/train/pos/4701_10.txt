 Roman Troy Moronie  is my comment on the movie  What else is there to say  This character really brings out the moron in Moronie  A tough gangster with an inability to pronounce profane words  well  it seems that it would have been frustrating to be tough and yet not be able to express oneself intelligently   Roman Moronie will go down in the annals of movie history as one of the greatest of all morons  There is of course great comedy among the other characters  Michael Keaton is F A H  and so is Joe Piscipo  I just like the fact that Moronie kept the movie from an  R  rating because he could not pronounce profanity
