As a lesbian  I am always on the lookout for films relating to gays   lesbians  However  with this kind of crap out there--it would be enough to discourage any audience  I kept waiting for something to happen--anything --a story to develop  or just for it to make some kind of sense  Neither occurred  It was just meaningless scenes  unconnected in any way with anything  The film failed to conveyed any kind of story or depth to the character  After an hour or more of this nonsense  I simply turned it off  Don't waste your time on this absurdity  1 Star - and it doesn't even deserve that
