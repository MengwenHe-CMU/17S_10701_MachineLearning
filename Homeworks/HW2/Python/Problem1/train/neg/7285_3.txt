The sun should set on this movie  forever  It goes on forever  which isn't usually a bad thing - The English Patient  Schindler's List  but is SO tedious  The aging of the actors is unbelievable and so is the drawn-out never-ending story line which really seems to go nowhere  In short  a waste of talent and film
