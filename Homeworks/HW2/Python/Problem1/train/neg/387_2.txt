One has to wonder if at any point in the production of this film a script existed that made any sense  Was the rough cut 3 hours long and was it trimmed into the incoherent mess that survives   Why would anyone finance this mess  I will say that Tom Wlaschiha is a good looking young man and he does what he can with the dialogue and dramatic     situations he is given  But characters come and go for no apparent reason  continuity is non-existent  and the acting  cinematography  and direction are  to put it politely  amateurish  Not One Sleeps is an unfortunate choice of title as it will probably prove untrue should anyone actually attempt to actually watch this film
