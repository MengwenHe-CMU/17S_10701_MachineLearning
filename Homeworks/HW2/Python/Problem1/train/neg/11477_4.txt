Sorry my fellow Nevada City neighbors  but this one is bad  Brian must have had too much botox because he had very little facial expressions through out the entire movie  Alice looked like she had a board strapped to her backside  She was stiff throughout the movie  I looked up both Alice and Brian and was surprised to see the extensive bio of work  I would have guessed that they were first-year students  Ed Asner and Peter Jason carried the movie frankly with their banter and ease with every line  Ed certainly has not lost his charisma  I wish I'd taken the time to meet him while he was here  I love the snow scenes and scenes of stores and the church because I've been there  I make Nevada City my home and was anxiously awaiting the premiere  I was sadly disappointed  Sorry
