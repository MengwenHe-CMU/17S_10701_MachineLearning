Picked this up for 50 cents at the flea market  was pretty excited  I found it fascinating for about 15 min  then just repetitive and dull  It is neat seeing Mick and the gang in their prime  i wish there was not so much over dubbing of dialog so I could hear what there are saying and playing  The skits are politically dated and incredibly naive and simple  sort of poorly written Monty Python on acid  I spent more time looking at the late 60's England back drops rather then what was actually happening in the silly skits  This movie is a good reminder that times really change and what was important quickly becomes just plain silly  Good song  but it has now been played to death by this DVD
