This collection really sucks  I rented it  thinking I  d really would enjoy some good fighting  Man this sucked  Quick flashy cuts  an extremely annoying speaker  and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened  I  m thinking especially of Jet Li  s fight in Fists of legend and Jackie Chan  s fight from drunken master 2   And what  s the deal with those brawling streetfighters   What  s so  cool  about that  I  ve seen more interesting fights on Martial Law  This a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people  Do not ever buy this film  Do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap  Instead  go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory
