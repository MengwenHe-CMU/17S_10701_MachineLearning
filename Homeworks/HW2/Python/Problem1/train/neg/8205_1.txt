Very bad acting  and a very shallow story  Not even a decent B-Movie Events that were suposed to be shocking like humans geting on board an alien ship were boring and very lame  This is one of the worst sci-fi I've ever seen  I saw the 5 0 stars and decided to watch it since i like the genre  but it sucked so bad  Now there's really very few good movies on ALIEN subject  I think because most of them are low budget I give it 3 10
