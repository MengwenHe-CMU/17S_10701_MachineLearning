The question  when one sees a movie this bad  is not necessarily   How did a movie this bad get made   or even   Why did I see this awful in the first place   but   What have I learned from this experience   Here's what I learned  - Just because the  rules  of horror movies have been catalogued and satirized countless times in the last ten years doesn't mean someone won't go ahead and make a movie that uses ALL of them  without a shred of humor or irony  - If your movie has to be described as   loosely   based on the video game  you have script problems  - The black character may not always die first  but the Asian character does always know kung-fu  - While you may be proud that you figured out how to do the  the Matrix effect  on a budget  that doesn't necessarily mean you should use it over and over again ad nausea  - Being Ron Howard's brother does not guarantee choice roles  - Whenever a scene doesn't edit together  just use some footage from the video game  no one will notice  - If your cousin's rap-metal band offers to write your movie's theme for free  politely decline  - Zombie movies are not about people killing zombies  They're about zombies killing people  preferably in the most gruesome way possible  That's what makes them SCARY  - White people who can pay  1600 to get to a rave deserve to die  - If you find an old book  it will tell you everything you need to know  Anything else you will figure out on your own two lines after someone asks   What was that   or   Where are we   - Bare breasts are not horror movie panacea  - A helicopter boom shot and a licensing deal with Sega magically transforms your movie from  student film  to  major studio release   Try it  - Just because you can name-drop all three  Living Dead  movies  that does not make you George Romero  Or even Paul W  S  Anderson  I've seen worse movies  but only because I've seen  Mortal Kombat  Annihilation
