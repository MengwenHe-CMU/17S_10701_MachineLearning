The movie appeals to public due to charisma of Ben Stiller and notoriety of J  Aniston  It seems that we have here a recipe for a successful title  but there's nothing successful in this movie  Polly is very well played by Aniston  no doubt  This is the kind of character which suits her perfectly   Bem Stiller is the same troublesome guy like in   Meet the parents   but in this movie the comic scenes are few compared to the title mentioned above  The script is very poor with nothing special at all  With this two well payed actors the things could get a lot better - but what can they do when there is such a poor story and script  4 out of 10
