I heard many stories about this film being great    Well  I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month  I watched it  and I have only a few comments about it  1  Terrible story-line  2  Terrible acting  3  Bad fighting-scenes    I never seen any worse movie in my life so far   When the storyline is bad  than at least make the fights something more interesting  But BOTH are done ridiculously bad      The only positive thing about this movie  in my opinion  is Nikki Berwick  God  she looks nice in this movie  That's about it
