Watching  Der himmel   ber Berlin  as a teen in the late 80's was a profound experience for me -  so this was what the movies could be   Along with  Paris  Texas  and  Until the End of the World  it still holds a special place in my heart and mind - a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders  Unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with  Million Dollar Hotel  and  Land of Plenty  hitting a terrible low point  Gone are the captivating pictures or music  No search for or display of great insight  All that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements  that boils down to nothing but clich  s  and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience  Has the well run dry  Whatever the reason  it's time for Mr  Wenders to either step it up or stop altogether
