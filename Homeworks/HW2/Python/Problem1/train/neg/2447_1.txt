After watching KHAKEE i felt i'll get to watch another good film but sadly The film is a joke and actually trying hard to introduce Aryeman Afterall his father Keshu is the producer RKS spoke so highly about the film during promotions  saying the film has meat unlike films released that time  I wonder which films was he talking about The film is actually a typical Masala film with loads of comedy  romance  action everything jumbled The ease at which the kids kidnap the family  is one of the funniest parts ever  Imagine kids kidnapping Dawood's family The end is a complete jumble mumble with sudden change of characterization RKS gives his weakest film till date  except some Bachchan scenes the film is a bore Music is boring Amitabh tries to give the role his all  he does his part well  though not his best though he contorts his face too much when pulling a trigger and does a weird look while smoking the cigar His dubbing too isn't matched properly at times Akshay is there for some minutes and just repeats his act and hams Aryeman seems expressionless  tries too hard but overdoes it in some scenes Bhumika emerges the best of the lot The rest are okay
