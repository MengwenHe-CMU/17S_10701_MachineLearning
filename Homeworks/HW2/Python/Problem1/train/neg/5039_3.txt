Rex Reed once said of a movie   Julia and Julia  to be specific  that it looked like it was shot through pomegranate juice  I was reminded of that as I snored through Purple Butterfly  This one appeared to be shot through gauze  The story was boring and it was not helped that for large portions of scenes actors' faces were literally out of focus or would only come into focus after extended periods of time   Also  everyone looked the same so it was hard to distinguish among the characters  I call this the  Dead Poets Society  syndrome  There was nobody to care about  nobody to become interested in dramatically  and the movie shed no historical light on a very interesting period of time and set of circumstances  A total disappointment
