I mean  really    either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie  It's stupid  ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL  Since i saw the preview i knew it wasn't going to be a great movie  i just didn't think it was gonna be that bad    What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie  When the actors didn't have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny   Now we find ourselves with movies like this one  Borat  Little Men  Scary Movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts   Just skip this piece of garbage P S   sorry for my English
