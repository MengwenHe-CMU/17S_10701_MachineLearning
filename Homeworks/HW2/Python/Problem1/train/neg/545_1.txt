this is just usual Indian garbage that gets turned out as cinema  as Indians we can proudly boast that we have the biggest cinema industry  however it also the worst  how can other poor countries have films with real characters that challenge the views of their respective societies and we just keep on pumping out garbage  take a look at Russia  Iran  china and Latin America  look at the brilliant films they have and we get crap like Kisna   get real people  no wonder the international community in general laughs at Indian cinema
