This is the absolutely worst piece of crap I've ever had to watch - actually it was so bad that I just HAD to watch it  -  The CGI is sooo bad it's fun  It's not even close to the shitty CGI animations in Spawn  that's how bad it is  har har har    I'm amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on DVD  but I guess they'll get more money out of it that way  'cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars  It's so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it  See it and laugh
