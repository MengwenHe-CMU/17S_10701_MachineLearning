Elvis Presley plays a  half-breed  Native American   Indian   who has to defend his reservation from nasty business tycoons  Everyone likes to get drunk  fight  and make children  Fighting  wrestling  and  punching out  each other replace the stereotypical hand-raised expression  How   Although he does have make-up on  it's obvious Elvis is healthier than he appeared in prior films  possibly  he was getting ready for his famous  comeback   It couldn't have been because this movie's script was anything to get excited about  Joan Blondell trying to seduce Elvis  and Burgess Meredith in  war paint   should be ashamed  The best song is  Stay Away   actually   Green Sleeves  with different lyrics   The most embarrassing song is Elvis' love song to the bull  Dominic   There are some surreal scenes  but it never becomes trippy enough to succeed in that genre  though   Stay Away  Joe  might provide some laughs if you're in the right  mood   Otherwise  stay away      Stay Away  Joe  1968  Peter Tewksbury   Elvis Presley  Burgess Meredith  Joan Blondell
