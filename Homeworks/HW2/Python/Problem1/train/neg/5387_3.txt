In one instant when it seemed to be getting interesting  it never got there  The people are going from one point to another point  with really no point  if there was one it was very dull   There was no action  suspense or any horror and the characters were pretty heartless  so there was no caring what happened to them  All together the movie was pretty boring  I give it a 3 10  I like that it wasn't shaky choppy camera-work and if there was music it didn't annoy me like some really bad movies and the acting was not horrendous
