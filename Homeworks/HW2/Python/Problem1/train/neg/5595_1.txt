Wow   OK  So  after reading the little feud on here  I decided I had to see this movie for myself  This movie is HORRIBLE  I stopped watching it  I strongly recommend cleaning a closet instead of watching this movie  you'll be more spooked entertained  It's low budget with bad acting  Whoever is giving this movie 10s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded  I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers  Simply put  this movie is not worth watching  Very  very BAD MOVIE
