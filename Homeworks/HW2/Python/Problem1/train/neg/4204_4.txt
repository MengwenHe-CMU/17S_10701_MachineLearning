David Arquette is a young and naive home security alarm salesman taken under the wing of Stanley Tucci  Arquette is a golden boy  scoring a big sale on his first call- to widow Kate Capshaw and her dopey son Ryan Reynolds  Things are going well for Arquette  he is appearing in commercials for the security firm and he is falling in love with Capshaw  Then Tucci and his right hand woman Mary McCormack let him in on a little secret- they sometimes break into the houses of their clients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy security systems from the firm  Arquette decides not to get involved  taking Capshaw to meet his family  and going through life with a goofy smile on his face  Then  someone breaks into Capshaw's home and murders her and her son  Arquette suspects Tucci  and sets a series of traps  resulting in a gun to his boss' head as Tucci pleads his innocence  Based on a stage play   The Alarmist  is not opened up well  The scenes where Arquette takes the Capshaw to meet his parents are badly played and completely unfunny  They are also out of line with the character Capshaw is playing  as she gets drunk and tells sexually explicit stories to Arquette's mom Michael Learned  Other than these scenes  Capshaw is not given much to do  but she does a lot with the little she is given  Stanley Tucci  looking just like Terry O'Quinn  is a riot as the security firm owner  He is a creep who really does not understand Arquette's moral revulsion  However  when he turns into a sniveling whiner after Arquette kidnaps him  he is hilarious  Mary McCormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role  but she mostly stands around and agrees with Tucci  Ryan Reynolds is too old to play a dumb teenager  but he is funny  especially telling his own explicit sexual story to Arquette  The screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy too soon  Capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated  except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can break into her house  Capshaw and Reynolds are in the film just to give Arquette a reason to take revenge on Tucci  Arquette  who has proven he is a good actor  is awful here  He relies on the constipated mugging that got him through those AT T ads  and he is not a strong enough presence to build this weak film around  Actually  Reynolds might have been a better choice in the role  Dunsky's direction is good  nothing that will win an Oscar soon  Christophe Beck's light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir this film tries to be  and it is really catchy on top of that  Despite the pluses  Arquette's failure as a lead and the script's schizophrenic quality sinks the film  I do not recommend it  This is rated  R  for physical violence  gun violence  some gore  strong profanity  brief female nudity  sexual content  strong sexual references  and adult situations
