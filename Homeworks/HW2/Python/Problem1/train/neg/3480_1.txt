This movie is terrible  TERRIBLE  One of the worst movies ever  I cannot even imagine Gigli being worse that this  Previews made us say  NO   but then looking for something amid the dreck out there right now  we decided to go ahead and give it a shot  STUPID US  Affleck is NOT an actor  He's an image and can look good with explosions  but not even the kind Bruce Willis got in  Die Hard   If he stripped his shirt and ran around fighting bad guys  it would be a comedy  The best part was Catherine O'Hara -- she's always good  Gandolfini flops again  if it weren't for The Sopranos  he'd be washed up  like he did in  The Mexican   Affleck hogs every scene and as others have said -- no character has any motivation whatsoever for their actions   AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS
