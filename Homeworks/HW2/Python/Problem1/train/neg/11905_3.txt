With a tendency to repeat himself  Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'Paris Texas'  'Land of plenty' is no exception  Taking into the fact that I anticipated an average-mediocre film even before I went in  Wenders' ambitions seem to always get the better of him  It's taken for grated now his films are heavy-handed and bombastic  I weren't sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Middle America or some thriller  The outcome of Diehl's character is wholly predicable  Wender's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying  He was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes  I am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly  this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction  Interesting that Wenders professed that while making 'Paris Texas'  he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script  Yes  that was Wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter  His films from the past 15 years  were a total mess
