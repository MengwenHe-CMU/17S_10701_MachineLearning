I rented this movie tonight because it looked like a fun movie  I figured that you really couldn't go wrong with a concept of Ex Girlfriend with super powers       but the movie was confused and pointless     it seemed that at every turn the writer kept throwing junk in  Also the writer kept throwing in way too much toilet humor and sexual situations that only a teenage boy could love  It seems that it could have been so simple to draw a story out of Fatal Attraction Super hero    but I guess not   This is not a fun romantic comedy it was advertised to be  You could not take a child to see it and you would be embarrassed seeing it a date   If the writer could have done a basic story around the high concept and cleaned it up - the movie might have a fighting chance   A serious waste of time  B
