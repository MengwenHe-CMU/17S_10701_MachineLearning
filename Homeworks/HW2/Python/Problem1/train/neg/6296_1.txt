This film looked interesting  I'd read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightly  Started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations  In fact  I didn't bother watching the whole thing    utter drivel - bad performances  bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters - that was the point of the film  I guess  Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekend  Do not bother with this feature
