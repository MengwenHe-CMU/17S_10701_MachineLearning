usually I support independent art and i try to be very comprehensive and tolerant   i tend to support everybody  because their efforts are worth    but this movie just moves away from all comprehension and tolerance limits  imagine the following situation  1  think about the REALLY WORST horror movie you have ever seen in your life so far  2  think about some great  attractive ART for that movie's DVD box   and a promising plot    3  voil    you got ZOMBIE NATION  see it only if you really don't have anything else better to do  ANYTHING is better
