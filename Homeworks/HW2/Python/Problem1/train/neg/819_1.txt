 The Domino Principle  is  without question  one of the worst thrillers ever made  Hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream  I give up     How Gene Hackman and director Stanley Kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks  I hope they spent their money well
