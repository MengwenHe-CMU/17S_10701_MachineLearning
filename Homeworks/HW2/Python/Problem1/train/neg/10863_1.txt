LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie   I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u                                        This movie really waste yours time and money   I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema-hall                                                       Role of CIRCUIT was very small n useless n this movie   I think SANJAY-DUTT cut down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI                         Character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one  this movie show u the result of OVER-CONFIDENCE           The ideas of MAHATMA is also not define and confusing                   A REALLY VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
