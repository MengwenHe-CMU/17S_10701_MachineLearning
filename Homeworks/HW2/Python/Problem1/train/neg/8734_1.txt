Maybe I've seen one too many crime flick  or maybe I don't take the right drugs  This was the most clich   ridden  plot deficient  plot-absurd  just plain stupid movie I have seen in a long time  As for the direction  it looks like it took less time to show this than it did to put it together  In fact it looks like to made it straight to video before it was completed  It's a bad rip off of  M  the classic Fritz Lang film starring Peter Lorre  You'd be SO much better off renting that instead
