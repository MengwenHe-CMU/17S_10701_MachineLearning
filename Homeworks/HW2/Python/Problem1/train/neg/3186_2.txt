I didn't think it would be possible for Joe Don Baker to make a movie as bad as his stinkbomb 'Mitchell'  but this one succeeds  I wouldn't recommend this if you're a fan of Joe Don Baker's MUCH better work  But if you like to watch fat guys sweat and really  really drawn out gun fights  you'll love this movie
