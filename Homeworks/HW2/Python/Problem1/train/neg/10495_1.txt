I think the Croc Hunter is a pretty cool guy  I know I wouldn't have the nerve to go even 5 feet away from a croc  But  everything in this movie is bad  Farting jokes  people getting eaten  and the skit about the President all make the movie one of the worst of all time  It's a really bad film that you have to stay away from  All the  jokes  are so juvenile that you will find yourself laughing because they are so stupid  The plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old  I'm surprised the Croc Hunter did not beg the crocodile to eat him after he saw this
