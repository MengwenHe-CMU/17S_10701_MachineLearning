Reasons to watch the movie  1  Bo Derek at 16 looks good and occasionally gets naked  She does a pretty good job playing an immature  insecure 16 year old beauty  in fact 2  Many shots of a pretty Greek island But  1  Peter Hooten turns in the worst performance by an actor since Brutus played Caeser's friend in  Roman Senate Proceedings of March 15   He delivers each and every line in a delightful baritone bellow  Turn down the volume whenever he speaks  Preferably all the way down 2  Bo's fantasies are sadly tame  especially by today's standards  A few turns in the bath and as a fully clothed model 3  The plot is skimpier than Bo's costumes
