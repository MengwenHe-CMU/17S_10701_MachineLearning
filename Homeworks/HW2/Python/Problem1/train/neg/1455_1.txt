I have rarely been subjected to such outright nonsense in a film that is supposed to be based on a historical figure  A horrible joke of a film  I cringed throughout  Terrible  trite  distorted and riddled with outright lies and half truths  The famous Hitler biographer Ian Kershaw was to originally be a consultant for this film  However  he found the script to be so historically inaccurate and ridiculous that he refused  and also demanded they stop using his name as a source  it embarrassed him to think people would think he was involved   One scene shows Hitler beating his dog  There is not one source for this  Hitler loved animals above people  He brought in the strictest animal welfare laws in Europe  banned vivisection and animal experimentation  He was also a vegetarian  The film turns his gaining of the Iron Cross into a farce  involving bribery  Utter lies  He was awarded it for repeated acts of bravery over a long period of time  There are no historical documents showing that Hitler ever had a sexual relationship with his niece  Not one  Apart from these  Hitler is portrayed as a rabid simpleton in this garbage flick  If he was even half as ignorant  demented and thick as he is in this nonsense film as in real life you would not even know he had ever existed  Never mind become the leader of Germany  Honestly  this film was utterly terrible  Go watch Downfall and give this a very wide berth
