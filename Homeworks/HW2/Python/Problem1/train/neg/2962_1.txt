Movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining  So can Whoopi Goldberg movies  But Whoopi AND dinosaurs  After the first 20 minutes of  Theodore Rex   I had come to one conclusion  this movie is evil  Evil  vile  wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience  Nothing this bad is made by accident  this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber  First of all  Whoopi does not make good action movies  watch  Fatal Beauty  if you think I'm lying   but the film makers don't care - she's a tough cop here  yet again   Seen a million cop buddy flicks this week  Well  here's number one million and one  pal  Don't like cute  humanistic animated dinosaurs since that Spielberg TV show about them  Too bad  here's another one and he's a cop  too  You one of those people that hates car chases  shoot-outs  sloppy dialogue  boring futuristic FX and seeing talented people  Goldberg  Mueller-Stahl  Roundtree  stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write-off  A BIG tax write-off  And you read this review all the way to the end  You DESERVE a sequel  Seriously  No stars  not a one  And if they really make a sequel to  Theodore Rex   Hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise-cracking foam rubber dinosaurs  Now  I'd pay to see that
