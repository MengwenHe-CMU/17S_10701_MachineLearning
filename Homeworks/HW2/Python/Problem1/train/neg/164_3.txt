I'm not a huge Star Trek fan  but I was looking forward to this  I was intrigued by the pre-hype descriptions of the Enterprise  its cramped-submarine styling and rough-edged technology compared to the Treks we are used to  I didn't see anything all that interesting in this pilot  I found the plot to be convoluted and confusing  I will admit that I did like some of the character development - the depictions of the humans as an 'adolescent' species ready to outgrow their britches was entertaining  And that Vulcan babe had one hell of an incredible rack  But I don't think I'm going to get hooked on this series  3 10
