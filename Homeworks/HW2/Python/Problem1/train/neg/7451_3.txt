Sorry  not good  It starts out interesting  but looses its way a few minutes into the movie  It does not help a lot that none of the normally great actors  Quaid  Glover  Ermey  Leto etc   delivers a really good performance   It might be owed to the fact that I saw a dubbed version  german   but Dennis Quaid's character was especially wooden and annoying  and Danny Glover does not really make for a believable villain  Moreover  Jared Leto's character does not really contribute to the story whatsoever  except saving one main character's life at one point  but that scene is as necessary as a windshield wiper on a submarine in the first place  -  Speaking of unnecessary scenes - the main complaint is really the tangled and clich  -ridden storyline  The detective  of course   has to settle a personal matter with the villain and is  of course   suspended from his official duties courtesy of his personal entanglement  The killer  of course    wants  to be tracked down and plays a cat-and-mouse game with his opponent for years     I don't know how many movies build on a similar plot - most of them better  however  The plot has got holes galore and many completely unbelievable and unnecessary scenes that do not contribute to or work well with the storyline at all  e g  the truck stop scene or the car at the cliff's edge etc   To top it off  the ending tries to be original and exciting  but fails completely in these regards  We've seen  much  better finales with a similar kind of ultimate-battle-on-a-train-in-a-forlorn-winter-landscape setup     In the end there is the supposedly moving reunion of parent and child     hokey  at the least
