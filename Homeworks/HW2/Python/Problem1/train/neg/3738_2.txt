That's what the title should be  anyway  This movie combines guns  explosives  and mindless killing to make one flop of an  action  movie  Let me make my point in a series of questions  answers type deal  What happens in the movie  People die  Is that it  Yes  What is the plot about  What plot  What is the point the movie is trying to make  Killing is the only solution  What are the characters like  Extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities  Is there anything good about this movie  Yes  I'm sure they used some nice Panavision cameras in filming it  If you like constant killing and greed  then watch the movie  If you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard  entertainment   then  Made Men  is not for you  To sum it up  the plotline stinks  the characters aren't worth their while  the storyline is completely resistable  and nothing fits together  This proves one thing  the actors  directors  and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't  Made
