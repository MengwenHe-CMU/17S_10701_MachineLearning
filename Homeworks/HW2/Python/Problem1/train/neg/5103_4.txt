I've long heard that to get their start in 'legitimate' films  many behind-the-camera types work on porno films  The people who produced and directed this monstrosity stayed too long  Poorly paced  staged and written  it uses a lot of perfectly good talent  Diehl  Dorn  Eggert  badly  Much sexual activity is teasingly implied here by the brassiere-popping host to the alien creature  but it never crosses the line    You'll still want to shower afterwards  though
