for all the subtle charms this student film may contain  was anyone else bored to death waiting WENDINGO to show his paper macho face   the anti-climax pretty much ruined any sort of momentum we had speed actioned to develop  don't get me wrong  i'm all into exploring America's dark underbelly  but this is a turd-a-flamb   that gets a nod to watchable only for the fact that p clarkson looks hot taking it  sadly  from a guy from wings  the best 2 minutes the film has to offer  if you felt like ripping off DELIVERANCE  you could do better
