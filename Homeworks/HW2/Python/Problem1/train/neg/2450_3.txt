I watched Peter Jackson version of Lord of the Rings when I was half way through reading the Two Towers and I thought it was absolutely brilliant  At this time the animated version of the Lord of the Rings was released on DvD but I told myself that I will finish reading the Two Towers and Return of Kings before watching it  as I thought it showed the whole of the trilogy   So when I did finish the trilogy I went and brought the DvD  which was a stupid idea because it was absolutely rubbish  I was acturly bored 20 minutes in to it which was really strange because I love the book and I am shooked that the maker of this film could of even thought of fitting at least 1 and a half of the books in to a 2 hour 8 minute film  None of the characters had any emotions when they were talking and they seemed to be reading it of a page  even my favourite character who is Gandalf did not seem interesting at all   The animation was the only okay in parts of the film except for the orks  they looked awful  and Aragorn and Sam face  I don't know way this film was released because there was not even a proper ending  but maybe it was good that the maker ran out of money because the film couldn't of got any better   I just hope that nobody judges the books by this film  3 10
