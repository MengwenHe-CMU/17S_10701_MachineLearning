Rented it last night  The opening 2001  ran WAAAAAAAAAY too long  The hitchiker scene served no purpose  Some skits were just retarded  I knew beforehand  Chevy Chase was on for less than 2 minutes  No problem  Here are the best parts  KOKO  URANUS  BABS COMMERCIAL  Curtis Mayfield song Total  7 minutes of good material out of a 75 minute movie Everything else was either unfunny or stupid as hell  Let me give you some advice  If you want a crude movie spoofing TV and movies  rent  Kentucky Fried Movie   If you want a less crude movie spoofing TV and movies  rent  AMAZON WOMEN ON THE MOON  or  UHF  Otherwise  don't bother renting this movie  You'll save 2-3 dollars  IMHO  Ken Shapiro's best movie is STILL  Modern Problems
