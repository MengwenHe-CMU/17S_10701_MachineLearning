What a wasted cast  This is one of the most disappointing films I've seen  Usually Roger Ebert does not let me down  but I feel cheated after seeing this movie  The only thrill is seeing Elizabeth banks in her bra  That is a sorry statement about this movie  It held so much promise  but it was like dry humping a transvestite  This is self absorbed tripe  I cannot express deeply enough my bitterness at having sat through this movie  and hope I can forewarn you of the same disappointment
