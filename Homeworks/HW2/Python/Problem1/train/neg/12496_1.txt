To be brutally honest    I LOVED watching Severed  That's why I gave it a 1 10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative story filming acting everything  This film was a RIOT to watch  If you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them  you will really get a kick out of Severed  The story really doesn't matter  it involves some guy who's bald and has a sword and goes around beheading random people   But he has a supernatural twist    nobody ever sees him do it   Even when  in one very memorable scene  he walks into a jampacked night club and whacks off some girl's noodle and nobody sees it   Severed doesn't merely look like it was filmed on video- it WAS filmed on someone's home camcorder  The filmmakers had knowledge of lighting  very thin knowledge  and composition actually holds together in some scenes  But mostly you can't hear the actors    you can't understand what they're doing  and you laugh when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body  Go and rent this movie  Support films like this- they are a hoot and a hollar
