Ever notice how in his later movies Burt Reynolds' laugh sounds like screeching brakes  Must have been hanging out with Hal Needham too much  And from the looks of  Stroker Ace   WAY too much  Can you believe this was based on a book  Neither could I  but it was  And probably not a best-seller  I'll wager   Burt's another good-old-boy in the NASCAR circuit who hitches up with Beatty as a fried chicken magnate with designs on his team  Anderson provides what love interest there is and Nabors does his umpteenth Gomer Pyle impression as faithful mechanic best friend Lugs   A lot of people here are friends of Burt's or Hal's  Others must have needed the work  And even real NASCAR drivers get in on the act  and look to have more talent than those with SAG cards   As far as laughs go  Bubba Smith  pre- Police Academy   gets them as Beatty's chauffeur  And Petersen  in full Elvira mode  gets lots of appreciative leers as a lady who wants to get to know Lugs real well  REAL WELL  It's a shame that Burt threw away as much time and effort in a film like  Stroker Ace  where it didn't matter whether he bothered to act or not  They didn't bother to write a character for him  why bother to act  Two stars  Mostly for Petersen  and for the out-takes at the end  Now THEY'RE funny
