I was expecting the movie based on Grendel  the book written by John Gardner in the late 1970's  It was based on the Beowulf epic  but told from the perspective of the monster   Whatever you may think of Gardner's book  a movie based on the Beowulf epic should not be entitled Grendel  when it doesn't say anything more about the monster beyond the few pathetic scenes in which the CG monster is shown as nothing more than a modified Predator   On top of this  the writers should also be punished for screwing up the original story so badly and contributing to the continued growing ignorance of mass TV audiences throughout the US  Typical Hollywood to get this so wrong   Very disappointing and a complete waste of time
