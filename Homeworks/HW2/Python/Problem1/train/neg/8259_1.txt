I saw this movie way back when it premiered  It was based on the notion that autistic children could communicate with typed-out messages with someone else merely aiding them and guiding their hands  Then suddenly these children  many of whom weren't even observing the keyboard or the screen when the messages were being typed out  they could be looking up at the ceiling in some instances   but their moderators were eyes glued on the keyboard  began typing messages of abuse from their parents and other persons  sending parents and child welfare agencies in a proberbial tizzy  left and right  This whole thing was proved a fallacy when a third person presented a folder  opened it to the child and said 'type the picture you see'  then as the presenter turned the folder to the moderator  a fold would fall down  revealing another different picture  So while the child may have seen a dog  the moderator saw something like a boat  Every time  every bloomin' time  the name of the picture typed was what the moderator had observed  never what the child was shown  So who was doing the typing  Never the child  This movie further took a disastrous turn with  as the Australia poster stated  the person who molested the child in the movie was IN the situation trying to help the child  Had Melissa Gilbert never put her son IN that place  he wouldn't have been molested  is what the movie says  He was better off under her supervision  If I turn my kid over to your organization for aid and he gets molested instead  do you think I'm going to be keen to listen to anything you have to say after that  Not likely  I think it is a safe bet that all of these accusatory messages that these kids were typing out  that this movie was based on  they never accused someone within their operation as took place here  Unfortunately  I do recall that the movie gave a very good performance from Gilbert as the mother of an autistic  but other than that  the movie really didn't do much  The worst by far was the child typing at the end to Patty Duke  and we hear the mechanical voice read back what he typed             we won   This child was molested  If you cut my leg off and I take you to court and you are found guilty of damaging me  assault  whatever  then that is legal justice  but it doesn't bring my leg back  At best  in my condition  I will view it as a hollow victory  Whatever chance this child had at what is perceived as normalcy with the autism alone is further damaged by the molestation  A 'normal' child has enough to contend with from such an experience  It's utterly superficial to think that you must look upon any situation and go 'we won' if that person is found guilty in court  Just a bad handling of a situation and circumstances all the way around here
