You know this is gonna be a cheesy movie when  1  It was made it the 50's 2  It's in black and white  3  It has no name actors  4  Screaming makes up for the lack of special effects  Well not to be outdone - this movie brilliantly incorporated all four of the above elements to turn this into a true cinematic blunder  Okay - shhhhh but I am gonna discuss special effects here - or lack of them -  Did you catch the underwater scenes  It looks like it was poorly filmed through an aquarium - note the cape flapping in the breeze  And the repeated re-use of Stock Footage   exterior house shots  the bridges scenes -- great enhanced the K-R-A-F-Tiness of this film - not since  PLAN 9  - have I seen such creative usage of stock footage  And hey where there was a lack of special effects - not to worry - screaming DOES take the place of special effects in this movie as well  Yes this movie even cleverly used that old hack trick  Grab the popcorn - set your brain on stun  several fermented beverages DEFINITELY helps   sit back  and wonder  why the heck did they put this on film again  Wayno
