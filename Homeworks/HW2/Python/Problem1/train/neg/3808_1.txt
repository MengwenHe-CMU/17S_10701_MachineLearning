WARNING  This review will reveal the ending of the movie   Scoop   If you don't want to know how the movie ends  don't read this review   Scoop  is so bad you'll think  Annie Hall  was a fluke  It gets one star because you get to see Hugh Jackman's naked chest  That's the only thing  Scoop  has going for it  Woody Allen's misogyny  and his fixation on women young enough  at this point  to be his granddaughter  has crippled any ability to make movies he may have had at any point  The plot seems promising  a ghost  Ian McShane  directs a fluffy headed student  Scarlett Johansson  to investigate whether or not an English Lord  Hugh Jackman  is the notorious Tarot Card Killer of prostitutes  A magician  Woody Allen  helps the girl  Promising plot notwithstanding  the movie completely lacks charm  or humor  or atmosphere  It's an amazingly leaden  amateurish effort for someone who has made even one previous film  never mind dozens  Perhaps Allen has had a stroke that has gone unreported in the press  Much is made of the fact that unlike in his previous films  Woody Allen  now a septuagenarian  has FINALLY allowed a younger male lead to get the girl  Not so  In fact  the plot is constructed in such a way so that the girl gets no one  There is an early scene where Johansson  for no reason central to the movie  allows herself to be gotten drunk  and seduced  by a powerful  older director   Seduced  is a euphemism for what happens  It's a  slam  bam  I've gotta go  kind of moment  It bears no relation to the plot whatsoever  and it cheapens Johansson in the viewer's eye  Why did Allen add that unnecessary scene to the movie  Because it shows a powerful director - like Allen - having sex with the female lead  Allen gets to have his cake and eat it  too  Johansson is not yet an actress  She doesn't know how to command the screen except by wearing a tight  low cut top  She imitates Allen in a couple of scenes  and that just looks weird and sad  It doesn't help that her character is scripted as a doll who can't function without a ghost  or an elderly and less than awe-inspiring magician  telling her what to do at every turn  She is approximately half Jackman's age  and she comes across as a very vapid screen presence in their scenes together  Audience members not obsessed with breasts deserve better in their heroines  and Jackman deserves better  too -- a script that gives the heroine some intelligence and agency  and an actress who can convey those qualities  Hugh Jackman is similarly cheated by the script  Allen apparently can't stand it that Jackman is so stunningly good looking and young  and so he gives Jackman nothing to say or do  Like Johansson  he is used merely for his good looks  This is a shame  because  as Jackman has shown in any number of productions  from  Oklahoma  to  X Men   he CAN act  Here's the big plot twist -- Jackman  suave  charming English Lord  really is a killer  So  though the movie says it is all about letting someone else  other than Allen  get the girl  she doesn't get anyone  Jackman  the man she's been making love to  is a man who murdered a prostitute  Nice  Woody  Nice way to punish your heroine for being beyond your grasp  In a passive aggressive touch  Allen deprives his heroine of his own presence  as well  killing off his character  the magician  leaving Scarlett Johansson all alone at the end of the film  A final note  at my screening  not a single audience member laughed at any point during the film  Always a bad sign when a film is advertised as a comedy
