'Succubus'  the edited version of 'Necronomicon Getr  umte S  nden'  is a struggle to sit through  even at a lean 76 minutes  any more of this dreadfully boring and pretentious Euro horror tripe and I may have slipped into a coma  Jess Franco once again delivers a truly awful piece of 60s trash that appears to have been made by a cast and crew out of of their heads on Class A hallucinogenics  since not one second of this mess made any sense whatsoever  Apparently  this is one of the better of his 180  films    it's hard to believe that there are worse efforts out there  The unfathomable plot deals with Franco's usual themes of sex  violence and lesbianism and throws in a bit of S M for good measure  and yet it still manages to remain mind numbingly tedious  I may leave it quite a while before entering the world of dodgy Euro Horror again    life is too short to be spent watching bilge like this
