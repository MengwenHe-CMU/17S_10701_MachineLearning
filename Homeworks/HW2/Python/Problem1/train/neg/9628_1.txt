This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen  The DVD was given to me free with an order I placed online for non DVD related items  No wonder they were given away  surely no one could part with money for this drivel  How some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief  the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot on  How on earth a talented actor like Philip Seymour Hoffman could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable  Mostly toilet humour and badly done at that  Anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs
