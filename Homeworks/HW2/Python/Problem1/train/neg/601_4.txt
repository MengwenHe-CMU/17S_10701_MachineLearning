      OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS       I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clich  s in horror movies  Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this clich   list to a film studio instead of using it for class   Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clich  s turning up here   In fact there's so many clich  s and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground   I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless Not to be totally negative I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies   Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's slightly better than 1972's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground   it's just that when you think all the clich  s have been used up in this film another clich   comes along to raise its ugly head
