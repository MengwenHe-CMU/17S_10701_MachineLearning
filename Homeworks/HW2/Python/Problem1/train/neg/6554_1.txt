I wouldn't give this movie a rating  it's not worthy  I watched it only because I'm a Pfieffer fan  I love her and would watch anything she made  Even in this dud  she didn't disappoint  Every scene with her in it  kept the viewer watching   waiting   for something to happen but nothing ever did  It had some good story lines but they ended abruptly as soon as it started  Some of the other characters had potential but nothing became of it  Pfieffer was 29 when she made this film and at her most lovely  The wardrobe and set was surprisingly good   I can watch mostly anything and rarely come across a movie I can't find something to like about it  but this was a dud  I don't understand   The worst thing about it all  it had a big cliff hanger at the end  It had an ending scene that woke you up and say wow  this film is finally going some place  then the credits roll  Good grief   I agree with the review that said  99 would have bought 3 cans of cat food and watching my cat eat would have been more exciting  Well said  Actually  that comment was more entertaining than the film because it sums it up so well  I too wasted  99 cents on this dud dud dud
