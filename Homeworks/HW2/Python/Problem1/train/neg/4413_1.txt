Broad enough for you  Wait till you see this heavy handed adaption of a little collegiate one act  What is shocking and wild in college rarely holds up over time  and this is proof  To take on the Catholic Church with broadside humor just isn't shocking or interesting or funny  it's kind of boring  The performers are all game  giving all they've got  but it's basically a play that doesn't open up to film well  Not a lot of fun
