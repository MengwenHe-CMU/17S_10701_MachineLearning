Some might scoff  but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films  This misses out on all fronts  A bunch of young people -- women with heaving breasts and continuously wet T-Shirts  naturally -- go to film  blood surfing  and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile  Not only was the croc obviously fake  but some of the props  notice the boat hitting the reef in particular  look like they've come out of thunderbirds  No good  from start to finish  Don't see it
