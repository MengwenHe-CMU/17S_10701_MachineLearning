I honestly want the last 30 minuets of my life back  The only person that is fit to watch this movie is Helen Keller I kept saying to myself this has to get better this has to get better  Then the zombies finally showed up and they had some raccoon paint on there eyes  They talked like regular people  One drove a car  Some voodoo woman asked what one of the  Zombies  wanted and the   zombie  said   I want to Dance    THAT WAS IT  Out came the movie I couldn't take it any longer Can I sue for a    hour of my life
