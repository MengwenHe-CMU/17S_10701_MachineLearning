We laughed our heads off  This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep  My dad was a sea captain for 30 years  he could not believe his eyes when he saw the movie  During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship  the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey daily and  sorry  s  t on his desk  Of course this was not on a nuclear mission  For instance  the fire in the kitchen  fire is the most important thing on any ship  nuclear or not  To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script  When a captain is put under arrest  he IS under arrest  you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept  This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room  He CANNOT escape  it's just like in prison  Funny thing is  my dad also had a dog on board  however  we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room  This is not done  ever  My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was  Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for  all the rest is bulls  t  When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk  this film gets an extra dimension  If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent  Thas Boat
