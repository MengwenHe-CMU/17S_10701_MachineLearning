I've read all the comments on this film  I am a great admirer of the Dalai Lama  As such  I read the book upon which this film was based  The movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth  I do not criticize it for altering small details or events for dramatic purposes  it is not a documentary  But the script CHANGES the impact  reaction  realities  and changes in EVERY main character  It vastly alters the real relationship between Harrar and the young Dalai Lama   From the ridiculous rivalry for a Tibetan woman  which demeans the culture of Tibet  to Harra's music box gift  to Harrar's change of heart  everything about this movie is false - except for the amazing photography  I understand that the shots of the Potala  the palace  were smuggled out of Tibet  However  changing a real story about the relationship between two people  one of them very important to this world  in order to build up a movie star is sad
