 Not only do alien visitors look exactly like furry armpitted human woman and not only are alien visitors able to perfectly speak English  with an Australian accent  they ALSO call their stars by the SAME names our Earthly astronomers have given them  And topping all that off  all alien life knows just how mean  evil  wasteful and destructive us humans are  And they're quite willing to tell us just how bad that is  If you ever have the chance to see this movie  don't  Well  unless you suffer from insomnia or the choices are this movie or exploratory surgery without anesthesia  This movie tries to get a moral  ecological point across but only succeeds in making you yawn and pray it ends soon
