at the beginning i was happy to know about a new superman movie   i though that will be great but it wasn't  is a bad copy of the Richard Donner work Lex is again a villain that makes no more else   even played by Kevin spice  the evil plan is the same of the first movie of Donner just a lot forced  the script is predictable and simple  all stuff Luthor finds in a museum or an old lady   the story is the wrong thing   it must be the Kevin Smith Script and may be it could be better  i just hope a sequel without Brian Singer and with a new talent director to do something new and not a copy  all read you later
