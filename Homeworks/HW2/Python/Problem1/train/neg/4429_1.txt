What a piece of stupid tripe  I won't even waste time evaluating any of the points of this show  It's not worth the time  The one comment I will make is - why get such a DUMB  inarticulate doofus to be the star    There aren't many more dismal testimonials to the deteriorating mental condition of the networks than the fact that FOX has stated it will NOT bring back John Doe  a decent series  but WILL bring back brain-dead drivel like Joe Millionaire for yet another round of killing the brain cells of the american public  FOX has lost it  IMHO
