A film starring Salma Hayek and Colin Farrell  two respected and talented actors  sounds like a great idea  An independent film sounds even better  The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativity  But then why is this movie so bland  Ask the dust  This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters  No one is given a proper back story  so we don't ever know why the characters act the way they do  Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination  if you still have one left at the end of this movie  I told a friend that I went to see this film  and that I thought it was awful  Her question   Not even Colin Farrell could save it   My response   Not even Colin Farrell's ass could save it
