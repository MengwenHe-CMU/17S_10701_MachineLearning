   Possible Spoilers    When I saw this today I had some expectation of how it would be like  not too high  but not low either  This was nothing like I expected at all though  it seems to me like the movie makers couldn't make up their mind of what kind of movie to make  In the begining of the film it's somewhat mysterious and kinda exciting  but that'll soon change to some ridiculous scenes - very obvious scenes    As I watched further I almost fell asleep a couple of times  The ending is the most ridiculous of all though  almost splatter comedy    I'm not saying it doesn't have some good scenes it's just that the film never becomes  whole   4 10 Movie-Man
