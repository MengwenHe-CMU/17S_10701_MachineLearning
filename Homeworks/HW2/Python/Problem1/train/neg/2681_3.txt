A very good story for a film which if done properly would be quite interesting  but where the hell is the ending to this film  In fact  what is the point of it  The scenes zip through so quick that you felt you were not part of the film emotionally  and the feeling of being detached from understanding the storyline  The performances of the cast are questionable  if not believable  Did I miss the conclusion somewhere in the film  I guess we have to wait for the sequel
