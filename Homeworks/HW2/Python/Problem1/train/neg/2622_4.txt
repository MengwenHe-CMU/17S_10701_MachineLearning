102 Dalmatians  2000  Dir  Kevin Lima   Believed to be cured  Cruella de Vil  Close  is released from prison and sets out to make a new start in life  Things are going well for Cruella who is busy helping homeless dogs off the street  When the clock strikes on Big Ben  things turn bad  The hypnotic cure is reversed and Cruella is back  and this time she is determined to make that spotted coat she always wanted  Glenn Close reprises her role as Cruella de Vil and once again is the highlight of the film  Every scene with her in is worth watching in this dull sequel  which feels more of a repeat of the previous film  rather than a new story  She's Changed     Ken Sheperd  Ioan Gruffudd
