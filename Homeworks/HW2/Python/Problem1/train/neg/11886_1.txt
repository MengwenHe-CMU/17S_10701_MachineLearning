Watching Josh Kornbluth 'act' in this movie reminds me of my freshman TV production class  where the 'not funny' had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were  OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try to synopsize this wannabe comedy  The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed  The delivery is painfully bad  OUCH        The writing is simply dorkish  It is akin to a Bob Saget show   Watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long Saturday Night Live skit  post Belushi    I hated this movie and want my money back
