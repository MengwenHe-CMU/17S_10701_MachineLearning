This sports a nice  deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk  The first third of this movie was nothing but talk  and more talk  Most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other   The first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it's really a  chick flick  and little else  This probably plays on the Lifetime network  There was a quick murder scene and then more talk  By halfway through  they had lost me   By the way  Sally Field looked about 15 years old in here
