If you have plenty of time to waste     it's OK  It moves at a good pace but to pull this movie off it would need to be a little longer with a little more background on the sitter   The acting is OK  Mariana Klaveno as the sitter does the best job and is the most believable  William R  Moses played a pretty good part as the husband  Gail O'Grady  as the wife  had a weak part and the reasons for her going back to work were not developed  The ending is sort of silly  Like most of these sitter movies     there are parts that are interesting     but overall it leaves you wondering why you spent the time
