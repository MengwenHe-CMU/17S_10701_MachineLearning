Based on Ray Russell's dark bestseller  this John  WATCHER IN THE WOODS  Hough-directed bust has little going for it  Though it does not lack gory violence  it lack narrative sensibility and  characters   The  Incubus  of the title is a demon endowed with a mammoth penis that shoots red sperm into vaginas during intercourse -- or  to be more precise  rape  John Cassavetes  moonlighting from his successful directing career  is convincing as a doctor who questions the circumstances of the bizarre attacks on young women  Horrific possibilities of the victims spawning demonic offspring are not considered -- and neither is the audience's tolerance for slow moving garbage  The script's reluctance to explore the dramatic repercussions of a fertile premise exemplifies the major problems with this vapid Big-Schlong-On-The-Loose exercise
