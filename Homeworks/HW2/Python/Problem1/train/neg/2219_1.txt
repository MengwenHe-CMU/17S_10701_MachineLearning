Perhaps one of the most overrated so-called horror classics ever made  Halloween does feature the memorable Michael Myers and some great acting by Jamie Lee Curtis  However  its rewatchability factor is very close to zero  as there is an unforgivable amount of time spent on dullness culmination to the actual events  This is the sort of movie you can walk away from to microwave popcorn and not miss anything at all  How it spawned so many sequels  I will never comprehend  Thank God Rob Zombie is remaking this  And generally  I hate remakes  Surely he will more than compensate for all the random time-filling gaps with some quirky points of interest that the original severely lacks  This is a movie we feel we have to like  much like the way we're taught that we SHOULD enjoy Dickens  Don't assume this is a classic
