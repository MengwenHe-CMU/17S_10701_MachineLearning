I found Grey Garden's to be a gripping film  an amazingly intimate look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea  forget society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge brood of cats and raccoons  persuing their own interests rather mundainly  all the while chattering at the camera  Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros  have chosen to document  They seem like characters out of a Fellini film  only stranger  if that makes any sense  Old Edie is almost fully bedridden  a pile of papers  clothes and dirty dishes growing around her  Little Edie is even more interesting  She prances around the house  always wearing a baboushka-like headdress around her head  completely covering her hair  We never see her hair throughout the film  nor do we ever get a hint that she still has much  At age fifty eight  though  she is still beautiful and full of life  In Grey Gardens  we get the sense that both of these women's lives have become much less than what they once were  Little Edie is probably the sadder of the two  While her mother  in her earlier years  got married  made a family  lived luxuriously and even made some recordings  the scene where  at 77  she sings along with a recording of  Tea for Two  she made decades ago is one of the films best scenes   Edie left her promicing career as a model to take care of her ailing mother  At 58  she still longed to find her prince charming  If anything Little Edie is still a little girl  full of dreams of glamour and fame  and of domestic and romantic bliss  that have yet to be fulfilled  Highlights of the film include the opening moments  where Little Edie explains her outfit to the camera  the  tea for two  sequence  the birthday party  the climactic argument  the grocery deliver scene  and the scene in the attic  The whole thing is incredibly candid and unpretencious  And it's made all the more remarcable since it's all real  I suggest seeing Grey Gardens back-to-back with the Kenneth Anger short Puce Moment  The Criterion DVD is  35 00  but it's worth every penny
