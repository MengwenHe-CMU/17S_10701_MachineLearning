This is a quirky little movie  and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well  It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist  and is partly about following his dream  partly about the dreams of others  and all about the travails of showbiz  I thought the movie was charming  and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile  Alan Arkin is terrific as the magician who never was  and his mentoring of Max makes for a funny and touching relationship  Not for everyone  probably  but if you like movies about the journey  then I think you'll like this one
