This movie leaves the intellectual mind thinking and trying to analyze the story  I too cannot understand why people would trash this movie  If you are a Jerry Bruckheimer fan  this movie may not suitable for u  This movie presents high degree of realism  The actors and actresses' performance is examplary  Not fake  just natural   No special sound effects  so special side effects  The camera work is excellent  the music is oh so good  I can't wait to get the soundtrack  It leaves your body numb  like Constant Garderner The directly has raw talent  certainly not a follower
