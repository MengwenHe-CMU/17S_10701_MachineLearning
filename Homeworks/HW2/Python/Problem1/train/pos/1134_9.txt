The only part lacking in this movie is Shue's part as the daughter wanting to follow in her  aunt's  footsteps as a daytime soap star  Otherwise it would be a perfect 10  It seems that every actor enjoyed their parts and overacting to fulfill their own enjoyment as well as the script - I have to wonder if a little ad lib'ing wasn't taking place in parts  It was well cast and there are some classic lines that will stick with you  It's a fantastic movie everyone should see at least once  I'd recommend not drinking anything that would sting coming out your nose  You'll definitely want to watch the last scene closely  'Nurse Nan' has a little secret she'd rather not have shared with you  If you love daytime soaps or despise them  this move pokes fun in all the right places
