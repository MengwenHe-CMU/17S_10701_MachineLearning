I know  that's not what you expect from a film with this sort of lineage- it's a direct descendant of The Best Years of Our Lives and The Men    films dealing with men who are in the hospital dealing with tragic circumstances  But this film is full of wonderful surprises and performances  It features stellar performances from Eric Stoltz and Helen Hunt  including a rather risque nude scene  and Wesley Snipes and William Forsythe  As Emanuel Levy wrote in his book Cinema of Outsiders  about the Independent film movement   The Waterdance is coherant  attentive to detail  and unsentimental with a wicked down to earth humor- it' s at once funny and sad  and the entire cast is impressive   I was extraordinarily moved by this film  it's hard hitting yes  but also has very tender moments and laugh out loud moments  A rare gem
