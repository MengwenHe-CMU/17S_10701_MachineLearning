It is an excellent thriller from Turkey which can make sense Great job from Gokbakar brothers  First of all i want to point on screen play Generally screen play in most films from Turkey is not enough but GEN has the best shots to be said  perfect  And also transition parts are really excellent  On the other hand  Gen  has a great topic that influence everyone Especially a woman  who wants to be a psyciatrist in a sanitarium  has a mother that is a habitual insanity Principal causes and psychological consequences are given in Gen The only thing you have to do is to combine all the hints  There is an impressive aggression part Doga Rutkay and Sahan Gokbakar played This performance may be more realistic than   Irr  versible Monica Bellucci     The last thing i want to say is  Watch this movie you'll get confused
