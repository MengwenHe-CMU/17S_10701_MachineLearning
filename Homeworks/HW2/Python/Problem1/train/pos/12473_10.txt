A warm  touching movie that has a fantasy-like quality  Ellen Burstyn is  as always  superb  Samantha Mathis has given many great performances  but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory  Most of all  you've got to see this amazing 5-yr  old  Jodelle Ferland  I was so captivated by her presence  I had to buy the movie so I could watch her again and again  She is a miracle of God's creation  Judging by the high IMDB rating  I'm not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress
