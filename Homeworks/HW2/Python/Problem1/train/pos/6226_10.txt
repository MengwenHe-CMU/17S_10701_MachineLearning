Astaire and Rogers at the height of their popularity  In 1936 Americans thought of the Navy as a place for song and dance  WWII was still a few years away  Fred and Ginger dance up the town  The plot is decent  but who cares    By the way  notice the cameo roles for Betty Grable and a glamorous Lucile Ball  A load of Irving Berlin songs  including the famous  Let's Face the Music and Dance   In that scene  Ginger's heavy swooping dress smacks Fred in the face during one of her spins and almost knocks him unconscious  Fred insisted on keeping the take as the dancing was superb nonetheless  Ginger once commented that she was a better dancer than Fred  since she had to do all the same moves  in step  and backwards    Come to think of it  Fred's voice was nice too  The man was effortless in motion  Here's a movie to cozy up on the couch with a loved-one  kick off the shoes  and enjoy the entertainment
