Overall the film is OK  I think it's better than Sepet and much better than Gubra in term of its story  its sentimental value  There are a few scenes that makes me touched  Yes I agree that the boy  Mukhsin  did his acting very good  Brilliant  I can say that his acting is almost natural  However  the song 'Ne Me Quitte Pas' by Nina Simone really  'menaikkan' my 'bulu' 'roma'    I love the song  Both the song   Ne Me Quitte Pas  and  Hujan   I just downloaded the song  Beautiful  And salute to Yasmin  The movie's ending credit makes me touched again  We can see how Yasmin really appreciated her parents in an unique way  I think the movie deserves that Grand Prix Of International Jury at Berlin Film Festival  I give 8 5 out of 1o stars
