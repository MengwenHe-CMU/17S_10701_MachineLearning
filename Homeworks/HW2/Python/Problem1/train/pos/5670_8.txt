Esther Williams gets her first post MGM starring role and gets off to a good start  This film is a well acted entertaining suspense with a mature theme that would be repeated a million times more in the future - innocent girl stalked creepy woman hater  Esther looks great and if she wanted to  probably could have gone on to do more and better films but according to her autobiography   pretty much gave up working for marriage  Either way she is so likable and engaging that its fun to see her in a totally different role outside of the 'swimming musical'  Universal was fabulous for making films with former MGM stars after that studio began dropping its biggest names as it began to slide down hill  Stars like Lana Turner  June Allyson and others got to make quality first rate films at Universal as they obviously still had drawing power at the box office  I wish Esther had made more but since she didnt  it makes this one all the more special
