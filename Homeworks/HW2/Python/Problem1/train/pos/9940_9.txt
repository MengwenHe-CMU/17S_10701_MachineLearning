This animation TV series is simply the best way for children to learn how the human body works  Yes  this is biology but they will never tell it is  I truly think this is the best part of this stream of  educational cartoons   I do remember you can find little books and a plastic body in several parts  skin  skeleton  and of course  organs   In the same stream  you'll find   Il   tait une fois l'homme  which relate the human History from the big bang to the 20th century  There is   Il   tait une fois l'espace  as well  about the space and its exploration  but that one is more a fiction than a description of the reality since it takes place in the future
