This has just been broadcast on BBC and I am absolutely delighted to have seen it  As the credits rolled  the cast alone made certain that I would give it a go  After just five minutes I was completely immersed in this beautiful film  Yes it was formulaic and predictable  but that somehow added to it's charm  The flashbacks to the forties were wonderfully placed and captured a feeling equalled in few productions  A real feel-good film  punctuated throughout with outstanding music  When it's released  I'll buy it
