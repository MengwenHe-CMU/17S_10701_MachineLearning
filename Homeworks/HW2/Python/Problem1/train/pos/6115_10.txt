Did you ever wonder how far one movie could go   Schizophreniac relentlessly explores the world of the extreme with Harry Russo   Harry is an aggravated writer  killer and drug addict scumbag who will stop at nothing to destroy those who stand between him and insanity  Driven by the demonic voices of his ventriloquist dummy rubberneck  Harry begins his killing spree   From director Ron Atkins comes the 1st installment of the vilest story ever to be filmed The only other movie I have seen similar to this would happen to be the 2nd installment entitled Schizophreniac Necromaniac This is a really low budget film and will not be for everyone  but if you are looking for something disturbing  different and horrific then this would make a fine choice  DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING LIKE MODERN DAY HORROR  Such as Scream  Viewer discretion is advised
