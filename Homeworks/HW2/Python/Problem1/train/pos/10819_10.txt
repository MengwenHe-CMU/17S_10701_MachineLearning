Sure this movie wasn't like  16 blocks  inside man  an American haunting  etc    But It was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us   i found this movie really great and scary  I live exactly where they filmed this movie  san pedro  California  And we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie  I dunno if you've heard of the famous boat in long beach  Queen Mary  Well that boat is haunted  i believe in spirts  illusions  and parallel or however u spell that  is real  everybody's in there own universe  and the mind is a powerful thing  i recommend to watch this movie  it's great  and not bad directing at all  for those who rate it a 1  they don't understand the film  its meaning  its plot  its view  and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us  Ty  Victor
