I really think I should make my case and have every horror and or cult movie-buff go and see this movie    I did  It-is-excellent  Very atmospheric and unsettling and scary    Incridible how they could make such a gem of a film with the very low read- no   -budget they had     Synopsis taken from website   One morning  an old man wanders out into the woods in search of his runaway cat  He finds instead a child without parents and a murder with no corpse     On this website IMDb  there is no trailer  but I will leave a link here to the site of the movie itself where there IS a trailer which is quite unsettling so please go and check it out    www softfordigging com
