Madhur from CHANDNI BAR started making realistic films  which some people called dry  He made SATTA which was another realistic though filmy film but a great film AAN men at work was a formula film by him which flopped He returns with his superlative PAGE 3 A film which dwelves into the lives of journalists and it's a brilliant film The film is well narrated though the half baked romantic portions of Konkana could be avoided but that is forgiven The entire Upendra Limaye track is superb too while the Atul Kulkarni track is great too The dial between Manoj Joshi and his friends are funny at first but repetitive at times The subplot of Bikram- Tara is brilliant and so is the entire hospital scene and also the final child abuse which shocks you The film has a open ended ending which is nicely handled Madhur does a great job Music is okay Konkana excels as Madhavi  using her expressions to the best Tara Sharma is decent except her voice Sandhya Mridul is good as usual Upendra Limaye excels in his part as the cop  one of the talented actors Sadly he isn't used well nowdays Atul Kulkarni too is good in his small part Boman Irani is restrained and does a great job rest are okay
