Blade Runner  Deckard is a Replicant     City of Lost Children  augmented senses or whatever used and abused and mostly  well  just giving us far less than what we might dream of   and Dark City   These really ought to be added  For a while now  I've been waiting for an animated film that might affect me as much as Miyazaki's stuff has  This one is the 1st  Hmm  scratch the  animated  part of that  I have an intense love-hate relationship with film noir and  hey  if you don't leave  it must be mostly love  right  But  there are so many sci-fi and noir themes totally submerged in this film that it's just a wonder to watch  These people did an incredible job
