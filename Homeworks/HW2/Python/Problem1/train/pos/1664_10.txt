I thought this movie was stunning  with completely outstanding performances by Valentina Cervi  Artemisia Gentileschi   Cervi portrays Artemisia so beautifully  with tentative yet confidant mannerisms  her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place  The passion to which Artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch  Although not each character was overtly beautiful  this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time  Overall i thought this film was fantastic
