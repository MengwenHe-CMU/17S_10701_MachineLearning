First of all I need to say that I'm Portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching Portuguese movies  probably one each year or even none       And the reason is the almost generalized idea between the Portuguese people that the national pictures are awful  really close to the worst ever made  However  in the last decade  it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when  Le  o da Estrela  e  Costa do Castelo  were among the worlds best of their time  with movies like  Pulsa    o Zero  or  Sorte Nula   both from director Fernando Fragata and also with some actors and music in common  This one is also good  not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy  in fact it's officially a drama  a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts  cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them  like the hypothetical travel to the Caribbean just to get laid   The plot works and can surprise us a few times  the actors are fine  the locations regular as the score  but the truth is that it all make sense  then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema  that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix  If you want to watch a Portuguese movie  surely you can take better option  but it stills one to be measured
