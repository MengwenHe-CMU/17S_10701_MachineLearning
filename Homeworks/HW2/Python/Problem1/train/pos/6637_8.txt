Story says that on that on December 28  1895  a small group of thirty-three people was gathered at Paris's Salon Indien Du Grand Caf   to witness the Cin  matographe  a supposedly new invention that resulted from the work done by a couple of photographers named August and Louis Lumi  re  The small audience reunited that day  some by invitation  most due to curiosity  didn't really know what to expect from the show  and when a stationary photograph appeared projected on a screen  most thought that the Cin  matographe was just another fancy devise to present slide-show projections  Until the photograph started to move  What those thirty-three people experienced in awe that cold day of December was the very first public screening of a moving picture being projected on a screen  history was being written and cinema as we know it was born that day  Of the 10 short movies that were shown during that historic day   La Sortie Des Usines Lumi  re   literally  Exiting the Lumi  re Factory   was the very first to be screened  The film shows the many workers of the Lumi  re factory as they walk through the gates of the factory  leaving the building at the end of a hard day of work  While a very basic  actuality film   movie depicting a real event   the movie took everyone in the audience by surprise  as their concept of moving pictures was limited to Edison's  Peep Show  machines  the Kinetoscope   the brothers' invention was like nothing they had seen before and so the audience stood in awe  as the people and the horses moved across the screen  The idea wasn't entirely new  Le Prince shot the first movie as early as 1888   but the way of showing the movie was simply revolutionary   La Sortie Des Usines Lumi  re  would become the first in the long series of  actuality films  that the Lumi  re would produce over the years  This primitive form of documentary was the brothers' favorite kind of film because they were more interested in the technological aspects of their invention than in the uses the Cin  matographe could have  Despite the initial lack of enthusiasm  after the first showing the Cin  matographe became a great success and  La Sortie Des Usines Lumi  re  quickly became an iconic image of that first screening  It definitely wasn't the first movie the brothers shot that year  and it probably wasn't the best of the 10 movies shown that day  personally I think that  L' Arroseur Arros    was the best of the 10   however  it is really meaningful that the very first movie was the opening of a pair of gates  as literally  this movie opened the gates to cinema as we know it  8 10
