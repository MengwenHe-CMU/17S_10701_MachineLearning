'Before the devil knows you're dead' is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time  The acting from the excellent ensemble cast is incredible  Philip Seymour Hoffman putting in an outstanding performance and is electrifying every time he's on screen  Ethan Hawke matches him scene for scene and Albert Finney simply chews up the screen  Marisa Tomei is  however  criminally underused  but looks amazing for her 42 years  The script is excellent  the story-line non-linear but easy enough to follow  Sidney Lumet  although not known for his blockbusters  has turned out a gem with this one
