A simple movie in the beginning  a simple movie in the end  It does have that un-ending and pretending cliche  but  most tv movies have that any ways  Christopher Reeve does a good job as being an ex-con drifter  The marriage between her and the woman he works for  I feel is a bit queer  but  I believe for the time period it is set in  that it is believable none-the-less  Now  I saw the edited 'tv' version  even tho the movie was made and showed on 'tv'  I find that a bit queer as well  But  I feel if I saw the entirety of the piece  I would give it more-in-likely the same rating  J T  Walsh does a nice job  not his best role  but  still    a nice job  7 10
