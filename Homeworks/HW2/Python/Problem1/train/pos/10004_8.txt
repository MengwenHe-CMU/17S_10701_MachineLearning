This isn't the comedic Robin Williams  nor is it the quirky insane Robin Williams of recent thriller fame  This is a hybrid of the classic drama without over-dramatization  mixed with Robin's new love of the thriller  But this isn't a thriller  per se  This is more a mystery suspense vehicle through which Williams attempts to locate a sick boy and his keeper  Also starring Sandra Oh and Rory Culkin  this Suspense Drama plays pretty much like a news report  until William's character gets close to achieving his goal  I must say that I was highly entertained  though this movie fails to teach  guide  inspect  or amuse  It felt more like I was watching a guy  Williams   as he was actually performing the actions  from a third person perspective  In other words  it felt real  and I was able to subscribe to the premise of the story  All in all  it's worth a watch  though it's definitely not Friday Saturday night fare  It rates a 7 7 10 from    the Fiend
