I liked this movie  Although halfway through it  I was able to tell who the secret admirer was  I am also wondering if it was based on a true story since it told about the  real  people at the end of the movie  I guess I will have to research it and let ya know  Does anyone remember what state this happened in  I believe they moved to North Carolina if I'm not mistaken  Of course the states could have been changed to protect the innocent  You would think that this man could have figured it out as easily as I did  Was he stupid or what
