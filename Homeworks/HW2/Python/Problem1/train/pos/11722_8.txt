To be honest I watched this movie only because of my pubert needs  I mean  I couldn't get women at my age  I was 9 or 10  so I thought watching Elvira's cleavage was the closet thing to sex  I ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy  Halloween parties  sassy humor  and some sexy evil displayed by Elvira  They just don't make movies like this anymore    It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style   The truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it's humor and the ability to perform by Cassandra   This is classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night
