THE SOPRANOS  1999-2007  Number 1 - Television Show of all Time  Everyone thought this would be a stupid thing that wouldn't go past a pilot episode  The Sopranos has become a cultural phenomenon and universally agreed as one of the greatest television shows of all time   James Gandolfini plays the enigmatic New Jersey crime boss  Tony Soprano  accompanied by a stellar cast  Edie Falco is superb as the worrying  loving upper-middle class mother  Tony Sirico is tremendous as a superstitious  greying consiglieri who is often very funny   While the show has often been criticised for the negative stereotype of Italian-Americans as mafiosi  and to an extent this is undeniable  I can see so many positives from the show  The portrayal of strong family values  friendships  love and compassion  could this be present in a coarse television show about gangsters  Yes  Furthermore  other burning issues are discussed such as terrorism  social inequality and injustice  homosexuality  drugs etc  This is no shallow  dull show about tough guys and violence  It has so much more  Many of the issues we see on the show are very real   The writing which has been pretty much great has infused so successfully current issues and managed to imbred them within the characters' lives  which makes the whole thing more interesting  Credit must go to David Chase who has created an excellent television treasure and to James Gandolfini  for envisioning  television's most complex and enigmatic character   Simply exceptional  10 10
