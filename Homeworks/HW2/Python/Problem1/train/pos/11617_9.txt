The premise is simple  This movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport  then things take a 180 degree turn    I for one  really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater  And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven  based on his previous meta-horror films  Sceam  does too    Following this logic  it's not surprising to find that Craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love'-story  only to have an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld     The scope of his character Jackson Ripner  Jack the Ripper  get it  lame  right   in this film is impressive  he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko  which is a plus in my book  As he proceeds to freak out his victim  Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams  who I found pretty annoying by the way   you can't help but sympathize with the guy    This is Wes Craven  embodied in Jackson Ripner  through Cillian Murphy  bashing all brainless chick flicks    Mr  Craven  I salute you  Best quote  Jackson Ripner  after beating the snot out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane toilet    Thanks for the quickie
