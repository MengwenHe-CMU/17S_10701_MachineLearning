I've only ever seen this film once before  about ten years ago  I bought the DVD two days ago and after watching it I think it is even better than I remembered it to be  Paperhouse is much more than just a horror  It had such an amazing level of emotion and great characterisation running through it  I especially thought Charlotte Burke was really excellent here  It's such a pity that she hasn't done anything else as she was an excellent actress altogether  Her portrayal of emotion throughout the film was perfect with just the right amount of subtlety to get the message across  especially at the end when she realised that although Marc had died  she knew he was going to be alright  Several scenes did make me jump  which is a rarity for me in modern horror films   most notably the scene in the bathtub  the scene where Anna's father was chasing her with the weird radio in the background and the bit where the legs broke apart and crumbled to dust  All in all  an excellent and very moving film
