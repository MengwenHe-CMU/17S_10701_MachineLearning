Like I said at the top  four stars just aren't enough  It's one of the best films I've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life  For the people that don't really like it or understand it  you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span  Even if I haven't seen all his films yet  I'd have to say that this is Spielberg at his peak  It's pretty sad to see that movies as great as  The Color Purple  don't come along too often 'cause I think all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture entertainment in these hard times  Movies like this are more than just movies  they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more  The idea that it was nominated for 11 Oscars  even Best Picture of the Year  and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid Hollywood can be sometimes  Spielberg wasn't even nominated for Best Director  It should have swept the Oscars that year  The film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people  If only movies were still this good
