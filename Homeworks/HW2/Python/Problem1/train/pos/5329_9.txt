This film was great  The plot was preposterous  The action sequences contrived  But  provided you can lighten up enough to laugh  it was a throughly thrilling romp combining Keystone Cops and the Lone Ranger  The baddies were more silly than bad  The good guys weren't too good  The black actors played normal characters rather than black stereotypes  The inclusion of a baby added a good touch  Sympathy might have been a little difficult otherwise   I have to disagree about the acting  It was  on the whole  very good  I really wanted to punch Judge Reinhold  And  after all  isn't that the mark of a really good movie  wanting to punch Judge Reinhold
