Wow  Something of a surprise  Though flawed  it is far better that I expected  The brand new space liner Arcturus with some 3 000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to Jupiter  Without warning  the ship's Cerebral  central computer  sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate   Soon  there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship's astrogators  Penny   the captain  Cary   and the director of the shipping line  Kenyon   It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main Cerebral is acting erratically  The remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and avoid personal conflicts in order to survive  The film starts out very well  The opening commercial is a very nice touch  There are obvious parallels to 2001  A Space Odyssey and to the historic sinking of the Titanic  The film does slow down at times and has pacing problems  but is generally well made and well acted
