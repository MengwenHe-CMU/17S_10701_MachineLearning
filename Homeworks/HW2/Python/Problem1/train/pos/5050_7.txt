We really enjoyed Grey Owl  a simple tale well told in classic Attenborough fashion  a little over-romanticized  with archetypes  humor  and a stress of dignity and values  Beautifully shot and told at a nice pace this is the true story of Archie  an Englishman who turned native Indian  and went to live and trap in Canada  Solid performances from all makes this film with a message easy viewing  Two of the stars of the film are without a doubt the cutest we have ever seen - and the message is a good one with its ecoleanings  It must have been great to meet or read Grey Owl in the 1930s  a unique character and this is a fitting film tribute
