One question that must be asked immediately is  Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis  The answer is  Probably not  But  thankfully  they are  or were  the cousin and aunt of Jackie  This documentary by the Maysles brothers on the existence  one could hardly call it a life  of Edith B  Beale  Jr   and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale  Edie   has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you don't want to look but you have to  Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton  New York  that is slowly decaying around them  The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle  Magnificent oil painting lean against the wall  with cat feces on the floor behind them  and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines  Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others  Clothing is seems to be optional  Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head  As Edith says  Edie is still beautiful at 56   And indeed she is  There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there  There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension  Their eating habits are  to be polite  strange  Ice cream spread on crackers  A dinner party for Edith's birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils  Time is irrelevant in their world  as Edie says  I don't have any clocks   Their relationships with men are oh-so-strange  Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness  She says  If you can't get a man to propose to you  you might as well be dead   To which Edith replies  I'll take a dog any day   It is obvious that Edith doesn't see her role in Edie's lack of male companionship  Early in the film she states  France fell but Edie didn't  Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said  Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other  There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film  Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food  The cats  and there are many of them  are everywhere  At one point Edie declares  The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility   But they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves  This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort
