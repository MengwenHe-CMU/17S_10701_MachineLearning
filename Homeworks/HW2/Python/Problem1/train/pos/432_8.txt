I only watched this because it starred Josie Lawrence  who I knew from Whose Line is it Anyway   the wacky British improvisational comedy show  I was very pleasantly surprised by this heartwarming and magical gem  It is uplifting  touching  and romantic without being sappy or sentimental  The characters are all real people  with real foibles  fears and needs  See it
