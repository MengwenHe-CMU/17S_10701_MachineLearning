This is one of the funniest series ever  I laughed till my sides split and rolled around on the floor  If only someone would release in America  Region 0 or 1 - Non-PAL please   I know it being released in the UK but that's Region 2 and PAL besides  Let's give this series its fair shake  America must know this series  Moffat is a genius  I loved Tracie Bennett's quirky  goofy role in this  Of course I liked Fiona Gillies  But Tracie was a treasure  Release this show in America  or Show it again on the PBS stations  I need to laugh and laugh again  Please indulge us  please  Please  Thanks for reading
