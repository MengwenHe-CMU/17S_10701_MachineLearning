I've just seen The Saint Strikes Back for the first time and found it quite good  This was George Sanders's first appearance as the Saint  where he replaces Louis Hayward  In this one  the Saint is sent to San Francisco to investigate a shooting at a night club  With the help of his acquaintance Inspector Fernack who has come down from New York  they help a daughter of a crime boss  Joining Sanders in the cast are Wendy Barrie and Jonathan Hale  Not a bad Saint movie  Worth seeing  Rating  3 stars out of 5
