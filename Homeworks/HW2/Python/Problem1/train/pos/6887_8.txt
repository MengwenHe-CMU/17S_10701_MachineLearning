This is a unique and bold film  It's energetic  with highly developed characters  Very good performances   I love directors who are not afraid to ask the audience to think     Bret Carr dares to look inward  ask questions  and dig underneath the surface  By the nature of the film  it practically demands that the viewer look inward as well  It can take some courage to do this  I can see how some close-minded people might find this quite disturbing  However  I found it thought-provoking  much more than just entertainment  Bret Carr is truly an original filmmaker  with vision  I am curious to see what he will do next  Watch him
