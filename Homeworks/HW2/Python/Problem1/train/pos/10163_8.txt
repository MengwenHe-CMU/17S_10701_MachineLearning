This had a good story   it had a nice pace and all characters are developed cool  I've watched a whole bunch of movies in the last two weeks and this had to be the best one I've seen in the two weeks  Jason Bigg's character was the best though  Even though it was small  it was cleverly crafted from the very beginning  This may be a romantic comedy and I don't like most  but the writing  direction  performing  sound  design overall in all capacity just was really thought out pretty cool  This film scored pretty high out of all the movie's I've seen lately - and the rest were big budget or better publicized  Good job in writing
