People call this a comedy  but when I just watched it  I laughed only once  I guess the problem is that I first saw it when I was 14  and I wasn't old enough to understand that it wasn't meant to be taken seriously  There were quite a few scenes that were meant to be funny  but I cared too much about the characters to laugh at them  I suggest that you watch this film next time you're falling in love  and try to take it seriously  I think you'll find that  despite a few silly flaws  it's one of the most moving love stories you've ever seen
