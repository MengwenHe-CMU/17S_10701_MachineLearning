This is the funniest stand up I have ever seen and I think it is the funniest I will ever see  If you don't choke with laughter at the absolute hilarity  then this is just not your cup of tea  But I honestly don't know anyone who has seen this that hasn't liked it  It is now 17 years later and my friends and I still quote everything from Goonie Goo Goo to the fart game  Aunt Bunnie to the ice cream man  Ralph and Ed to GET OUT   There are just so many individual and collective skits of hilarity in here that if you honestly haven't seen this film then you are missing out on one of the best stand-ups ever  Take any of Robin Williams  Damon Wayans  The Dice  George Carlin or even the greats like Richard Pryor or Red Foxx and this will surpass it  I don't know how or where Murphy got some of his material but it works  That is what it comes down to  It is funny as hell  Could you imagine how this show must have shocked people that were used to Eddie doing Buckwheat and Mr  Rogers and such on SNL  If you listen to the audience when he cracks his first joke or when he says the F-word for the first time  they are in complete shock  His first time he says the F-word is when he does the skit about Mr  T being a homosexual    Hey boy  hey boy  You look mighty cute in them jeans  Now come on over here  and f    me up the ass   The crowd erupts in gales of laughter  No one was expecting the filthy mouth that he unleashed on them  But the results were just awesome  I have never been barraged with relentless comedy the way I was in this stand-up  In fact  the next time my stomach hurt so much from laughing wasn't until 1999 when I saw SOUTH PARK  BIGGER LONGER AND UNCUT   That comedy was raw and unapologetic and it went for the jugular  as did DELIRIOUS  I don't think it is possible to watch this piece of comic history and not laugh  It is almost twenty years later and it is still the funniest damn thing on video    I took your kids fishing last week  And I put the worm on the hook and the kids put the fishing pole back in the boat and slammed their heads in the water for two minutes Gus  Normal kids don't do shit like that Gus  Then they started movin their heads around like this and the m    f      come up with fish  Then they looked at each other and said Goonie Goo Goo  I said can you believe this f    n shit    See it again and be prepared to laugh your freakin ass off  10 out of 10
