This movie is light  funny  and beautifully filmed  The lightning is absolutely superb  and the colours convincingly remind Vermeer paintings  This is sentimental comedy at its best  way above US and French standards  and arguably better than English ones too   Every character is touching  and interpretation is close to perfection  Isabelle Blais is splendid  Sylvie Moreau is better than in the Catherine series  St  phane Gagnon is charming  Emmanuel Bilodeau is great in that weird role of his  and Genevi  ve Laroche is the perfect best friend  I could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie  so give it a chance  and add your own review
