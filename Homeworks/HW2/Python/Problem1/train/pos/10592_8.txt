Pleasant story of the community of Pimlico in London who  after an unexploded WW2 bomb explodes  find a Royal Charter stating that the area they live in forms part of Burgundy  This movie works because it appeals to the fantasy a lot of us have about making up our own rules and not having to listen to THEM  A solid cast of British stalwarts  especially Stanley Holloway  makes this more believable  There are some very nice moments in the film  such as when the people have ran out of supplies and other Londoners on the other side of the barricade start throwing food and other things over to them  Even though you always knew Pimlico would become part of the UK again  the people of PImlico and as a consequence the viewer doesn't mind when this happens  leaving a nice happy feeling  It's amazing to think that these low budget movies from a small studio in London still remain so popular over fifty years later  The producers must have got something right
