If you enjoy Cleese   all the British 'Pythonesque' humour of the time  then this little gem is absolutely hilarious  Arthur Lowe is a real treat  I saw this with friends on TV when it first came out  and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years  and will do forever  I have it on tape and it is continually appreciated  Perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously  I can't believe it is now only available in the US  NTSC of course   and not in UK  where it should be an essential part of the history of British humour
