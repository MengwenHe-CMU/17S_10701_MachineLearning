I was waiting to welcome Arnold Schwarzeneger's return to action after the dismal movies he'd made after  Eraser    End of Days   however  can be added to the dismal films he's had the misfortune of appearing in   End of Days  starts well with a gripping action sequence  yet quickly becomes a bore  taking the focus off action and suspense and instead concentrating on the investigation of demonic happenings and the quickly approaching millenium  read  Doomsday     Performances are stale  special effects so-so  and gore plentiful  Considering myself a die-hard Schwarzenegger fan  I couldn't believe I didn't like this film  but with such an awful  lame script  what could Arnie have done  besides passed on this turkey  3 out of 10
