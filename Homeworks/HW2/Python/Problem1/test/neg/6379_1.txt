I have tried watching this show on several different occasions and each time found it to be utterly pale of humor  The reason  to mention one thing  is that it is solely based on ridiculing anything the Republicans have done  In short it is basically Democratic party political opinions touted as humor  All Mr  Stewart does is wisecrack about anything the Republicans have done and the audience wets themselves in gales of forced laughter  My guess is that the left is so devoid of any real substance that they have to define themselves in terms of how much they all hate Republicans  -LD _____________________________ my faith  http   www angelfire com ny5 jbc33
