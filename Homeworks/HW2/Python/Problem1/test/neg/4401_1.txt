 Won't be long on this movie  The first half an hour was one of the most boring i have had to face since i've started watching movies  The story didn't advanced  nothing was explained about any of the characters  It felt like a non-movie   A lot of people had already left the audience at this point   A lot of the scene were totally unjustified and unexplained  The director should have studied film a bit more to know that each sequence  each scene  has to make the story go forward  He never did that  The supposedly funny moments were contrived  and only a few people laughed  people with a weird sense of humor  i guess   Prize of the Jury in Cannes 2002     don't know what the jury was thinking about    probably the  politicly correct effect   I would have loved to love it  the disappointment was therefore even bigger  You have to see it to believe it  But wait for the video
