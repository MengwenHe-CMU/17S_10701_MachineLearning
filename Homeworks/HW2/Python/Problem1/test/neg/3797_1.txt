4 Oscar winners  Karl Malden  Sally Field  Shirley Jones  Michael Caine  Great character actors Telly Savalas and Peter Boyle  1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium  melodrama and horrible acting  a mess of a script  and a sinking feeling of GOOD LORD  WHAT WERE THEY THINKING  Irwin Allen was just trying to cash in on the popularity of the original classic disaster film with a grade D minus script  the actors were obviously just in it for the paycheck as well     the horror  the horror  How insane are the characters that Caine  Savalas  Malden and Field are playing  Go into a potentially deadly sinking ship that's 1  on fire 2  Hot from steam 3  Slippery from water and oil  4  boilers that are exploding every 5 minutes  etc   all for the love of money  Greed  5  They have very little equipment  not even a pair of gloves or work boots in sight  much less a grappling hook  rope  etc  Stupidity  What were they thinking  Peter Boyle overacts so much that I just wanted to smack him  Stop it  And what's the deal with the bad toupee  Also  there is no way you can believe his character was a WW2 veteran  Caine  Field and Malden find all that gold and money and they are happy--whoopee  We're rich   We may not live to spend it  but hey     And yee haw  it's the great character actor Slim Pickens  Survivors galore  Jack Warden and Shirley Knight  too  The final dramatic sub plot about that scary plutonium never really went anywhere  it's like they forgot  sort of  Lots of holes in the script  This film has an illness that the strongest pill couldn't cure  I'm surprised Alan J  Smithee's name wasn't on the script  I'd be embarrassed to have penned this one  Oh the insanity  Oh The humanity  Oy Vey  The Horror  The Horror  It's like a bad two hour TV movie  At least the sets were made from recycled material from the first movie  The script needed to be on the compost heap
