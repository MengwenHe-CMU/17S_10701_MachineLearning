I checked this out for free at the library  and I still feel ripped off  Yes  Sandra Bullock is actually in it  but only in five scenes totaling up to barely 5 minutes  and even those are fairly painful to watch  The rest of the movie is so bad that you'll spend most of the time hoping it will end soon  but only if you're one of those people who have to finish a movie once they start it  Everyone else will just turn it off  Don't worry  you aren't going to miss anything  Bullock's lines  assuming that you were tricked into watching this because her name is plastered on the case  are essentially just parroting of other characters lines  like this dialog  Lisa  Bullock  -  Danny  please tell me what is going on   Danny -  I don't know    Lisa -  Whaddaya mean you don't know    Danny -  I don't know - it's something to do with my Dad    Lisa -  Whaddaya mean your Dad    Danny -  I don't know - he     ed up or something    Lisa -  Why am I here    Danny -  I'm sorry Lisa  I don't know     moments later  Danny -  Some army buddies of my Dad          Lisa -  Whaddaya mean army buddies   See what I mean   Bottom line - Just say no
