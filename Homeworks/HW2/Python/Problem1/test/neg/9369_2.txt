I usually don't write reviews for shows unless I've seen them in full  However  there were so many positive views of this show on here I felt it was necessary to balance it out with a bit of realism  This show is hysterically bad  I don't think it was meant to be  but it is  I see that there's lots of praise being showered upon the show  and I honestly can't understand why--- this show is so poorly acted  the dialogue is so awful  and the plots are thin around their holes  I think that this show is interesting in that it is a definite litmus test of your standards  Some elements of the show work  and perhaps those elements are just more important to some people than those that don't work  which make the show nearly unwatchable to people like me  If you enjoy making fun of a show as you watch it  anticipating clich  d lines and such  this can be an enjoyable show to ridicule  if you have that sort of time on your hands  The pilot is a pretty fair example of the whole show  If the nonsense saccharin clich   ending doesn't leave you in a dumb shock  then this may be a show for you
