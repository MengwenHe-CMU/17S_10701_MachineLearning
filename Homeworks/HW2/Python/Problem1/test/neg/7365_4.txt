Much can usually be forgiven in period pieces that ask us to recall important historical events and spice them with enough love interest to keep the story going  BATTLE OF THE BRAVE tackles the 18th Century struggle for the control of Quebec  an all of Canada  between the British and the French with sidebars form the new America  It has the makings of a sweeping epic of fascination  but sadly in the hands of writer Pierre Billon  whose script deserves a Razzie award for worst of the season  and the scattered  unfocused  and confusing direction by Jean Beaudin this film is a dud - a two and a quarter hour tedious mess of a film  Even a cast a fine actors - pairing No  mie Godin-Vigneau as Marie-Loup Carignan with David La Haye as Fran  ois le Gardeur  adding the lovely Bianca Gervais as Acoona   the venerable G  rard Depardieu as Le cur   Thomas Blondeau  and the likes of Ir  ne Jacob  Vincent Perez  ridiculous in period wigs   Tim Roth as William Pitt  Colm Meaney as Benjamin Franklin  and Jason Isaacs as G  n  ral James Wolfe - doesn't help  Veteran actors such as these must have cringed at the crude lines written for their characters  Cover the whole mess in a sappy musical score by Patrick Doyle and the result is a long film to be avoided  Sad to say such bad things about a costly project  but be warned    Grady Harp
