Can u believe a college professor made this film      The same man who made DHOOP The film is horrible and has some of the weird scenes ever The main message is nice but presented badly The film looks like a collage of amateurish scenes  miscasts etc and bad performances Direction and everything is poor Music is okay Emraan's naughty streak works and he does well Tusshar is bad Tanushree and Isha are bad Paresh annoys when he looks at the mirror
