Oh dear  Oh dear  What were they thinking of  Terrible script  terrible acting  I don't even feel sorry for the actors    they took their cheques to the bank and smiled happily  Since when did an air shaft from Charing Cross pop out at Bank  Why are vehicles crossing Tower Bridge going in towards the City when the surge hit  Why is Tower Bridge not crowded when the city is being evacuated  How does Carlyle dive into a raging torrent     and survive  I could go on    and on  There is no real sense of urgency in the command room  They might just as well be waiting for the England eleven to come back onto the pitch after the tea interval at Lords  It says something when I await the adsbreaks to learn more about diarrahoea treatment with eager anticipation  Totally abominable trash
