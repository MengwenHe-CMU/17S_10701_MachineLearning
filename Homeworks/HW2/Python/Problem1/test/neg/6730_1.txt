I have to say that I really liked UNDER SIEGE and HARD TO KILL  watching Seagal doing his funny martial arts on people  I have been always looking forward to Seagal-Movies and  unfortunately  I was first disappointed by GLIMMER MAN  which I found really bad  THE FOREIGNER is probably one of the worst Seagal has ever acted in  Horribly boring  badly edited  wrongest soundtrack and so on  Dear reader  do yourself a favor an stay away from this  Honestly  Stay away
