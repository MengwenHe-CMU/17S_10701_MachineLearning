 Wired  would have to rate as one of the ten worst films I have ever seen  The writing and direction show a stunning lack of imagination and I'm sure that most of the actors still cringe whenever anyone mentions this film  It fails to work either as a tribute to Belushi's unique talent  or as an accurate account of his short life   A pointless mess with no redeeming features
