Bad plot  bad acting  bad direction  It had possibilities but just didn't achieve anything  This film looks like someone started with an idea  googled a bit of info and then tried to flesh an hour and a half with lots of night shots and bad suspense music  Others had to stop watching because they were scared 2 3 of the way through - I had to take a break purely because I just didn't care anymore  Reminded me of an episode of Days of our Lives with marginally more suspense  Just bad
