Another movie from Swedish hillbilly country  which is always the Northern part  If black people were shown this way  there would be shouts about racism and for good reasons  This is a farce and you are supposed to laugh at the  clever  farce clich  s  But it's mostly tiresome  A gangster comedy  with the bad Russians  as always  and the bad  and stupid  Finns  And most stupid of all is of course the Norwegian  according to Stockholm prejudice  Andreas Wilson is the only one who tries to make a performance reminding us of reality  This is not funny  This is not even exciting  A burlesque too raw to make you interested in any way
