Why does this piece of film have so many raving reviews   This is amateurish  unfunny and annoying  The only memorable thing here is the corny title song   The production values are low and the  comedic   if you want to call them that  ideas are weak  they seem like leftovers of leftovers from SNL that even they would not dare to have put on the screen  I'm beginning to thoroughly mistrust IMDb ratings   This is light years away from Kentucky Fried Movie - not even in the same Galaxy  It's not even possible to write 10 lines about it  OK  another good thing  ugly street scenes and ugly people - something one doesn't get to see a lot in todays TV and Movies
