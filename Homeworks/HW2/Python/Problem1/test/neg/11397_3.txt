They said it would be a film greater than Turks Fruit  How dare they  It's not even 10  of this classic  Bad acting  The only character i felt sympathy for was the one played by Angela Schijf  Her acting was the best in the whole film  The story could've been interesting  but it wasn't  Some scenes were very beautiful filmed  lights and camera    the opening scene for example   but the bad acting made the magic disappear  I really don't understand why so many people voted this film so good
