This film is  far and wide and beyond any shadow of a doubt  the single worst and most contemptible film in the history of the universe  It really  is  that bad  Personally I have always enjoyed the guilty pleasure of a terrible film  and rented this one thinking it would be one of those  To my immense disappointment  it was not  The script is delivered in a way that sounds as if they're reading the lines directly off placards  the story makes absolutely no sense whatsoever  and the actual film looks like it was shot on a home video camera  I couldn't even finish watching it  It is even worse than  Witch Academy   and that's quite a feat in itself  I cannot even begin to fathom how a director could shoot this film  and then still have the sense to believe it was decent enough to release  Painful  awful  horrendous
