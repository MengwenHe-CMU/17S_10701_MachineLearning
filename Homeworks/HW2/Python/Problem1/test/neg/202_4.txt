This looks so good on paper - Matt Damon  Lawrence Fishbourne  Jean Reno  nice right  And a heist with  42 million - sounds like a kick-ass crime movie  Big disappointment - I reckon the stars got all the money because the production values on this are lousy  But more than that it the pseudo reservoir Dogs atmosphere when the easy crime goes wrong  It's very much made for TV stuff  All in all hugely disappointing - it score points for being what it is - but loses them massively for being  bluntly  not very interesting at all
