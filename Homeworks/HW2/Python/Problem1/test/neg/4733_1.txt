Where to start   I think only three other films have led me to post a review on IMDb  and all of those were positive  As for this    Mind-blowingly  hideously  tragically  embarrassingly  catastrophically  stupidly  irritatingly  completely and utterly beyond awful  I am STUNNED this got made  never mind given a theatrical release  I think I am literally in shock  I'm no  snob   I didn't expect beautiful film-making or intense character-depth  but this is truly beyond a joke  We simply MUST demand more from the films we see  Avoid  Like the Black Death
