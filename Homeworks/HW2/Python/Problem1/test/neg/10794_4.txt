The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934  I purchased this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama  It certainly isn't  It is about a couple who head for Egypt to capture some desert drug smugglers  This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy  which lets it down a lot  It is quite silly in parts  Depsite this  there are some good action and location scenes  The cast is lead by Jack Hulbert with Anna Lee as the love interest  One viewing is enough for this movie  Overall  a disappointment  Rating  2 stars out of 5
