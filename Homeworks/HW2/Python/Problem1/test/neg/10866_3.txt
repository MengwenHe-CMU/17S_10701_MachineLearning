Larry Bishop is 60-years old  dirty and not good-looking YET in this movie he's like a drug towards the women in their twenty's  A lot of movies have been claimed to be sexist but if any movie deserves that title it's this one  I can't even count how many boobs there were shown in this movie  probably more then hours Larry Bishop spend writing the script  The script is ridiculous  Bishop and his gang argue  bike  party  have sex  kill people and the next day they argue  bike  party  have sex  kill people and the third day  well you get the idea  I like ERIC BALFOUR and considering what he had to work with  he did pretty good as Comanche  Unfortunately this movie is about Larry Bishop's character Pistolero who is so one-dimensional it's not even funny  He's also a horrible actor  and apparently he never intended to do the lead himself but everybody he asked said no so what was he to do  Once he realized he was gonna do the lead himself  he probably did a re-write of the script so that he could touch up more ladies  Although visually it's kind of good-looking  at least the biker-scenes and Eric Balfour isn't half-bad this movie is just a big mess  I hope to never see Larry Bishop in front of the camera again
