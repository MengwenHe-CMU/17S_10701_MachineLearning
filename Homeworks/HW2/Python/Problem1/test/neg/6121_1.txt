This movie was a waste of time  It looks nice  pretty settings  nicely acted  appears earnest and seems to be leading somewhere so you stay tuned awaiting a meaningful payoff  It doesn't happen   It surprised me that so much effort could be put into a movie  it was clearly very professionally done  and have an outcome that seems nothing short of a b-movie  Save your precious time and see a good french film like Les Visiteurs  funny   Jean de Florette or Manon of the Spring  I can't recall the language in Europa Europa  but that's another Great film--heavy but very worth viewing  This film appears to promise a lot but delivers nothing
