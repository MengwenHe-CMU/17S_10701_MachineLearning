This is one of the more unromantic movies I have ever seen  Casting  Richard Gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore  Diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself  Supporting cast not too memorable  Story  The medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting  The story is weak - not enough happens to make a movie about  There is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here   The setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive   NOT destined to be a great one to remember
