This is a parody  That means  there are no characters as such  they are all plain stereotypes  and the movie relies completely on the quality of the jokes  Well  there ARE quite some good jokes in this movie  Unfortunately  they are hidden in a mass of real stupid ones  If one expects all dialogues to be absurd  the fun wears off  You see  there is American Pie 2  my all time favorite teenager movie  It contains a lot of real original characters  Maybe the jokes are tasteless  but all the people have some kind of live  For example  they feel embarrassed if something embarrassing happens  That is what makes the jokes themselves actually funny   Not so this movie  every scene is clearly arranged as a pure parody  so there are no characters at all  therefore there is really no room for any sympathy  Too  if you know the original movies  you know whole scenes in advance  Add the fact that many jokes are not funny at all  and you have this movie  The only thing that saved me from getting completely bored where in fact the comments from some teenagers in the cinema where I was watching the film  Ah  and my personal highlight of the movie was the very short appearance of Melissa Joan Hart in one scene  Sigh  She is just too cool  she can't be real  Hmm  worth a whole movie
