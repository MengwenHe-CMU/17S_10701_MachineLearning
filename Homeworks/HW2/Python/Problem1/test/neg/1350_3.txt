I saw it tonight and fell asleep in the movie  That is something that I have not done since - I have never fallen asleep at the movies  I LOVE the original and have seen it several times and recommend it to everyone  This may have been the problem but I do not think so  because there were a couple of bright spots that showed if done right they could have made this movie work  Bette was under used and Anne was over used and miscast  I do not know why English or anyone for that matter let this go out in that condition  They billed this as a Sex in the City but better  Not a chance I liked Sex in the City a lot and was disappointed by this movie  So do not waste your money on this movie - go see anything but this
