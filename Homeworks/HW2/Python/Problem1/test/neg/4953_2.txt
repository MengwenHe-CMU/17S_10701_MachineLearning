Jack Brooks' quirks are  at first  somewhat charming and lend to the deliberately campy feel of the beginning of this movie  I found myself getting angrier and angrier as I was duped into seeing this one through to the end  in hopes that the payoff would be worth the super-tedious wait  The climax can't begin to make up for all the setup time  Normally one might expect shallow characters from this genre  But the fact that the wait-time-before-action index is so high  should mean that the meantime would be devoted to some interesting character development  Not so  While not without its initial charms  this movie ultimately infuriates  and disappoints  Wish I could get all that setup time back  to reinvest it into something that pays off
