I'm a big time horror fan  and I bought this movie from all the hype it was getting on the message boards  Well  let me tell you I don't know whom was giving it all the hype  but let me speak on a few things  First of all this film is  not  a LOT of things  It is NOT scary  NOT suspenseful  NOT overly gory  NOT overly sick  except for one season MAYBE  NOT beautifully scored     AT ALL  The premise of the movie is that a couple flee to a small island in Greece because they have done a little naughtiness in London  We don't even know what they did  but it is presumed that they killed someone     spoiler alert   The male lead kills a few people out of his perversion of  cleansing the island of perverts  oddly enough  The killings are cheap  the characters are cheaper and the effects suck  There is one part when he rapes a goat because his wife wont give him any in the morning  but even that is done without any care for how it is shot   end of spoilers The end of the movie is about the only thing that isn't totally predictable  I especially enjoyed when the  herder  farts on the husband  Anyway  if you can rent this and have 2 hours to waste go ahead  It's nothing better than a processed cheese sandwich on moldy bread  3 10
