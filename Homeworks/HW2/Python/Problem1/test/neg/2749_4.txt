As powerful as the true story of Phoolan is  this book this film is based on came out before she herself was released from Prison and had the chance to tell it   It is allegedly based on her diaries but she is illiterate  How does that work   That said  some areas of he film are accurate and the acting isn't bad  with some sensitivity being shown   Really though this story needs to be old in a TV series  Far to much happens to cram into a couple of hours   Read her autobiography  Highly recommended  It is a fantastic story
