As a fan of C J 's earlier movie  Latter Days  I really wanted to like this film  The nicest thing I can say  however  is that it's NOT an awful film  There are some good performances  and a few funny scenes  In particular  Tori Spelling has a couple of great scenes where she's talking to her fianc  's ex-boyfriend  Overall  though  it's pretty week  The script falls back on weird coincidences and clich  d movie moments way too often   The main character went to Stanford on a golf scholarship  and his high school buddy doesn't even know that he plays the game    Most of the time  this movie had no idea where it was going or what it was trying to say  There are a lot of scenes that are mildly cute  but ultimately turn out to be a waste of time  And you could easily cut half the characters from the film without losing anything  Still  for all it's faults  I would have to say that this is one of the better gay films of recent years  Which says a lot about how bad most gay films are  I'm hoping C J 's next film will be better
