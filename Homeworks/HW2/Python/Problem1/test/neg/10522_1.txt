Even my five year old was bored  Very predictable  and overacted  This movie couldn't make up it's mind as to whether it was slapstick  or wry commentary on the state of  pee -wee  sports  Characters were underdeveloped  could have done more with the connection between father and son both coming from an orphanage  Did not like the reference regarding the goalie slipping the laxative to his teammate   very mean spirited for a kid's movie  Typical  Mafia  behavior was boring and stereotypical  The dog  however  was so darn cute
