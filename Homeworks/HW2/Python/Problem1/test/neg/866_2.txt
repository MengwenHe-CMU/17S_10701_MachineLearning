This movie has to be one of the most boring and stupid movies that Perrugorria have done   It looks like a commercial from beginning to end  The   director  spent the whole time on a tripod  it doesn't have pace  rhythm  It's illogical  what a mess  You can tell what's gonna happen since the first 15 minutes  and the ending   Wow ------spoiler------- Jesus Christ  how the hell Perrugorria got shot  Are you serious  Worst scene of someone getting shot ever  ------end of spoiler----- Bad directing  bad script  bad acting   Really bad overall  I wouldn't recommend this movie at all  It's a waste of money and time
