I will never get back the three hours of life this film has stolen from me  The film is basically a psychedelic drug trip disguised as an important creative process  I'd love to know what they were on when this film was being made  Its also the most historically-inaccurate film in existence  2001 has come and gone without any of the events or predictions taking place  Characters are unlikeable  design is simplistic and everything just rambles on without any sense or logic to it  And the ending is probably the worst of it  its supposed to be thought-provoking but the only thought that entered my mind is  What the F  K is going on     I'd say for anyone looking for serious entertainment purposes  AVOID this film at all cost and choose a sci-fi movie that ISN'T stuck up its own
