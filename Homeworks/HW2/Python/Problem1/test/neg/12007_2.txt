I am having a hard time finding the words to explain just how much I detested this movie  The historical trial of Henriette Deluzy-Desportes and the Duc de Praslin is a tragic and compelling story that  I feel  had the potential to be a fantastic film  but failed   Although the cinematography certainly had something to say for itself  it in no way could make up for the terrible structure of the film  the badly written script and most of all the horrendously overacted characters  The worst of them were the Duc's children who were so over-the-top-corny and sickeningly fake that it was almost painful to watch  In conclusion  this film left me feeling nothing more than irritated and profoundly disappointed
