My Name is Earl 2005   Review       For I have seen this  This is something else  First off  how is this rated so high  I cannot understand that  This  show  is filled to the top with either annoying people  stupid people  or just plain unlikeable  The  gags  are hideous  I saw one episode where the wife of Earl's brother wrapped and washed herself with dead fish  Not kidding  That wasn't funny  that's repulsive  Then she and Earl's extremely stupid brother and I mean stupid  then had sex  I nearly threw up  This has to be one of the most desperate attempts at comedy in a long time  Jason Lee is a talented actor  but is trapped in a helpless role in this horrible  comedy   Earl is now in jail for this current season  Let's hope he gets the chair just so this show gets put out of it's misery  The Last Word  This show would be funny to people who think Larry the Cable guy is funny  To the rest of the world  NOT A CHANCE  Avoid like the plague
