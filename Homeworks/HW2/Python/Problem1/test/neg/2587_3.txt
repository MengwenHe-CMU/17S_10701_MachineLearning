Debra Winger's 1987  Black Widow  is MUCH better  This is like a lame version  and Jane Seymour usually does better  Chad Allen is pretty poor in this too  Just playing his usual role as a boring rebellious child  Maybe the both of them being from Dr  Quinn was supposed to make us get excited  If it's on  go grab a copy of  Black Widow
