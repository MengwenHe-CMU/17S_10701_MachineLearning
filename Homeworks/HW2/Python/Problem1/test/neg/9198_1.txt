If you pack all the clich  s about city firefighters into 105 minutes  you have Ladder 49  It has a story but is highly clouded by all the clich  s  It turns it into movie that with every event  becomes so predictable it's not worth watching  There is no depth to the story and even the acting seems superficial  It looked like it wanted to be a tribute to firefighters but ended up being boring and pretentious  The parallel between Jack Morrison being fatally trapped beneath an inaccessible part of a building and firefighters being trapped beneath the rubble of the Twin Towers was all too obvious  It doesn't compare to movies like Backdraft and certainly does not set an example for future movies about fire personnel
