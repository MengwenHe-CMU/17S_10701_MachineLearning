I turned this off about 50 minutes into it  Whoever the moron was who decided to steal the idea of Koushun Takami's book Battle Royal     make it into a pathetic reality TV show scenario  deserves to be shot  It has done the Film Industry a good turn though  Now Directors like William Malone Fear Dot Com  can say  well at least it's better than Series 7  This piece of crap   Dracula 3000 tie for first place in the worst 100 movies ever made   Be warned this is not a 'So bad it's Good'Flick  This is a disgrace to Film Makers everywhere   Never see this movie
