I'm giving it a three instead of the lower number it deserves because of its history  A full-length movie made by high school students  It shows  too  but that's part of the charm and appeal  Get ahold of some of the stuff George Lucas did at UCLA  this is better  Maybe due to being a group effort  A monster made of toxic waste and too much garbage--these kids were way ahead of their time --starts ravaging the town of Milpitas during a high school dance  The monster destroys randomly  leaving garbage and smelly footprints  The movie has local TV and radio people  the Milpitas mayor  the Samuel Ayer High School principal  and a whole bunch of the high school students and their parents  not to mention the mayor's daughter as the ing  nue  Dumb  Yeah  Fun  Yeah  Great screen writing  C'mon  they're untrained high schoolies  Copy that comment for the acting  cinematography  directing  et cetera  Milpitas is right next to San Jose in the heart of Silicon Valley  maybe one of the graphics geniuses there will update the video somehow  Now THERE's a challenge
