Not too good a movie  Sure  it contains action  but the effects aren't all that good for a '08 movie  Gunshot effects are downright horrible  Acting is  meh   It is nothing like Far Cry  other than names and the very basics of the story  genetically enhanced super soldiers going amok   The super soldiers are very different  the mercenaries are different  the setting are completely different  tropical island in the pacific in the game  island in northern-ish America in the movie   I loved playing Far Cry  I loved the story and setting  I hated the movie
