  contains spoilers   This movie is utter crap  Do not watch  There is no one in this movie to root for  or even like  except for the wife  and she wins by default  Everyone is selfish  and many things happen that make no sense  The acting is mediocre at best and everyone breathes too heavily about everything  No one can even cry believably  If you leave the room for even a second  then something totally out of left field will happen  and it will make NO SENSE WHATSOEVER  For example  I left the room for a second  while Jennie Garth's character was sleeping with her manager  I come back  seriously about 4 minutes later   also I'm pretty sure there was a commercial somewhere in there  and she's sleeping with that Berko guy   I gave up on this movie around the time that Berko was being an ass to his fianc   in the car  because she didn't want to call off the wedding  I wasted 2 hours of my life  You shouldn't
