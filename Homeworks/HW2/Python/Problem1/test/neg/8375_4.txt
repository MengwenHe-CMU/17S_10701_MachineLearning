I realize the line on my summary is not too polite  This film written   directed by Scott Caan   starring Giovanni Ribisi Don Cheadle   himself runs a long 88 minutes  There is a dog in this puppy of a movie   he is cute  The movie opened in 2 U S  theatres in late April 2007 for one week   grossed all of   914  It quickly went to DVD in early August 2007  We were only able to take about 40 minutes before we turned the DVD off  This was the type of movie that played on lower half of double bill  You saw the main film   figured lets see what this one is like  You might have walked out before we shut it off  The 3 actors   the young ladies in the film all have done   deserve better than this   Ratings      out of 4  54 points  out of 100  IMDb 4  out of 10_
