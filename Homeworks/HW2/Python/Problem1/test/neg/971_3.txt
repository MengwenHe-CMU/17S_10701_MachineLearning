MINOR PLOT SPOILERS AHEAD    How did such talented actors get involved in such mindless retreaded drivel  Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard violence prone tough cop  i e   he beats up the bad guys and rolls his eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book   and Eddie Murphy plays a not so tough cop who would rather be an actor  i e   he screams out   Freeze  police   and has his  tough look  down pat   Naturally  they are partnered when Bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot water with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a  Cops -like reality show  Take a breath  cuz that's as funny as it gets  No energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread of every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with  15 Minutes  starring  yes  DeNiro himself as  pretty much the character he is playing here   The jokes fall flat  the action feels listless  and no one seems to be having a good time  It's dead on the screen  Please don't waste your time  Even if you have an overwheming affinity for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor  Becauze if this makes money  these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptable for actors of their quality  And to Mr  DeNiro  You used to make serious films  I remember them - they were good  You were nominated for awards for them - remember how much fun that was  Now after  Analyze This   which was good    Meet the Parents   which was also good   and  The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle   which was NOT good   I think we need to see you parodying yourself less  and BEING yourself more   Casino  feels like a long time ago  And no  I don't count  15 Minutes  as serious Bobby  Anyone who took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news
