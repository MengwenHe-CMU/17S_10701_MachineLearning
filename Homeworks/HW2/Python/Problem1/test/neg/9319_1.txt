Well  I remember when the studio sacked Schrader and hired Harlin to do reshoots to this film  they were quite right to do so  Dominion  Prequel to the Exorcist is simply a bad movie  it's boring  really it is  It would be nice to think that the studio put aside a psychological masterpiece and that all those who in such big words condemned Harlin's version and praised Schraders  even if no one had ever seen it  would have been right  But they weren't  To put it in a nutshell   Schrader has no idea what a horror film should be  and it shows in a big way  Droll  boring  unintentionally funny in all the wrong places and bad supporting cast  Save your cash and your nerves  don't see it
