I like the most of the Full Moon Pictures so I ordered this movie from the USA  because in Germany you can't get it anywhere  I thought it would be so nice and amusing like the Subspecies or Puppetmaster Series  because they were full of atmosphere  I was glad when the movie finally arrived  But after watching this cheesy movie  I was very disappointed  The actors   I think you can't even say actors  are boring and untalented  The story was a poor performance and even the set and the monster were very cheap and lousy  I hope no one ever make a sequel or remake of this terrible movie   -
