Jude Law  Nicole Kidman  and Renne Zelwigger  They are all horrible  Especially the star  Jude Law   It's directed by the same guy who did the english patient and its based on a best selling novel of a man risking all to get back to his lover but unlike the wonderful English pateint  this movie sucks  It is really bad  Worst dialogue ever   But we've only know each other for a moment   But they were a thousand moments  like diamonds in a bag  or   In some cultures you just have to say I marry you 3 times and you're married  lovey-dovey- I marry you  I marry you  I marry you  I marry you     I'm ashamed I sat through it all   the whole movie was awful  horrible    Ughh no words  I'm sick  1 10  the one is for the really loud bullet sounds  the sound crew did a good job
