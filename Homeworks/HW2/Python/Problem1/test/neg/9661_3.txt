wow  this movie sucked  This movie was a embarrassment to the original sandlot  Everything about this movie was awful  The acting was horrendous  Every part except the part of the 'mexican' sandlot manager was terrible  Luke Perry  though only bit parts was absolutely awful  This was is worst role ever  Even the kid actor playing him as a kid was someone you'd want to punch  even in the end  lol  This movie reminded me of those kid movies that go that extra mile making a part goofy way beyond the funny stage  The humor was for 6 year olds  If your over 12 and want something worthwhile to watch  skip this movie and watch a sitcom instead
