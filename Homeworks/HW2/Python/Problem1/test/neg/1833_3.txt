Okay  I had reasonably high expectations for this  The controversial subject matter was a good concept  As a horror fan I admit I was fascinated and very excited about this  It turns out they had a great idea  but it was terribly executed  Let's see  This movie seems to run in 3 modes  Happy  Sex and Dark  The problem is that the movie never decides what it wants to be  The  Happy  parts I believe were meant to contrast with the  Dark  parts  but it doesn't work  The soundtrack is one of the reasons  The movie transitions between these 3 modes very badly  I can't even begin to say how much the directing and editing suck  There's sex in the most unappealing and unerotic way  I'm not complaining but even for Horror standards they were unnecessary and filler  The characters are all unlikeable with the exception of Paula  Potente   Her friend from Munich is a slut and possibly one of the most annoying characters in movies I've come across recently  There's a bit of plot which I won't go into detail    It's not stupid and in more talented hands would make a good movie  There's even a nice twist and a cool conspiracy going on  Don't try to understand everything because there are giant plot holes here  It's all so shoddily done that you don't care for the victims  the perpetrators  anyone  And to think this could have been great  I can say ONE good thing about it which is  the movie shed some light on today's unethical medical procedures  With genetics and controversial sciences advancing  this could have been a great philosophical film that raises and discusses these questions  But you won't find that here  just a series of scenes loosely pasted together with people and things that you don't care about  Skip this and go watch Flatliners instead  you're welcome  3 10
