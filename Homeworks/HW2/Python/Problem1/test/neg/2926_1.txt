I've just been at the cinema in down town Prague watching this film   Not due to the poster I found very Holywood old-fashioned heroic style  Not due to the high level starring which remind me that most of those high starring French films are usually pathetic  But just because there are not so many films in my French mother tongue in a city like Prague  And because I love Adjani  Depardieu and Rappenau's Cyrano  Then I decided to write up this small comment because I think I really don't agree with the comment main stream on this film on imdb  I was not disappointed  The film just look like the poster  The characters are just as stupid as they look like  For a while I thought Adjani would be like a caricature -- just a funny character you can laugh at  No she is not  For example when she decides to tell Depardieu she is the one who murdered the fat one she killed at the beginning of the film then come the violins in a big fat pathetic music which should make you cry and realize Adajani's character is a deeper person as she looks like  Maybe this was humor at the 10th level but I am sorry my sense of humor is not that high  If I want to see some funny French film on the WWII I watch once again La Grande Vadrouille  It is definitively more fun  I have also read on imdb that Lemoine is making a great performance in this film  I have to say I have never seen a so bad acting   Well I have never seen any Ed Wood's film   Nevertheless the film is good filmed with a lot of good  very costly  scenes like the one with the Pantheon in the morning when the German army arrives at Paris or when the refugees settle down on a bridge in Bordeaux  I think Rappeneau is a good filmmaker but that he does better with a good script  It was easy with Cyrano  He had not to write the dialogs  I give 1 10
