Typically elaborately crafted HBO production with a first-rate cast  a rich small-town atmosphere and some nice narrative vignettes  graced by above average production values  But  and that's a huge 'but'  the various subplots  peopled with some likable  mostly annoying caricatures  are paper-thin and go and and on in dull stretches for over three long hours  The often silly story veers uneasily between melodrama  without being entertaining enough  and personal drama  without being profound at all  A shame  because some scenes really shine  Two or three  that is  4 out of 10 grubby Paul Newmans
