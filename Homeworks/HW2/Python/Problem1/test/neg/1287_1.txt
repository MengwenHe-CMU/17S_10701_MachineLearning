This is a really bad waste of your time  I would probably rather go watch some documentary than this  it's really that bad  The acting is really terrible  and you can tell that the producers had a low budget because of the terrible picture quality  It's by far on the low end of the scale  don't waste your money on it  I have a really hard time believing the person who made this movie that it would fare well  I had to watch it with the kids when my mother rented it because she thought it would be good for the kids  Even the kids  3  4  6  and 8  all thought it was pretty boring  I agree with the other commenter  Spongebob would be a lot better to watch than this  Overall  Just don't watch it  Don't  Don't
