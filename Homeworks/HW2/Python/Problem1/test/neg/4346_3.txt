Not  confusing  in the sense that   Gee  this movie is really complex  and thus hard to follow   But confusing in the sense that   Gee  this movie really has no idea what it's doing   DREAM OF A WARRIOR is a Hong Kong South Korean collaboration  but it's all utter nonsense  A movie about parallel universes mixed in with time travel mixed in with love story mixed in with silliness  The film has the type of concept that boggles the mind  Again  not boggles the mind because it's so great and complex  but boggles in the sense that it's so ridiculous and one can't conceive of anyone ever coming up with such an awful premise to begin with  Nothing in DREAM OF A WARRIOR makes sense  and that's because the whole movie should never have been made  It is quite awful  The only saving grace is the actress who plays the female warrior  not the female lead   3 out of 10
