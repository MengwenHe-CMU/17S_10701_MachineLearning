The plot in Petites Coupures certainly left this viewer dumbfounded     spoiler    In the space of 48hrs or so  Auteuil's character has an affair with a teenager  loses his wife's affections  attempts to seduce Scott Thomas  is rejected by her goes on to grope yet another female character in the back of a car and then is finally shot for his trouble     end of spoiler    wha     The only saving grace in this flick is Kristin Scott Thomas  Similar to Charlotte Rampling  she seems a  natural  to star in French cinema  My hope is that one day Fran  ois Ozon may cast her in a part where she can show her true talent  There are some fine French films such as the remarkable Le Colonel Chabert begging for a DVD release  yet this is the tripe that gets chosen  Avoid this one  zzzz
