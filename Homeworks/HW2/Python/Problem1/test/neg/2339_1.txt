It  s a joke  right   Lynch could not get produced this as a TV show  He was out of money  so what to do  Well  he received somehow some Dollars and  completed  the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together    How can anybody see a failed pilot for TV as an cinematic masterpiece   And now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning   Well  wake up  there is none  Like in that other TV series by Lynch  what was the name again  Same procedure there  Build up a mystery and then come up with nothing  I guess Lynch will repeat this concept until people will realise  the emperor has no clothes   In Germany there is a comedian called Harpe Kerkerling  He dressed up as an opera singer and  performed  some new  art songs   Singing complete nonsense like this    The wolf  The lamb  On the meadow  Hurrz    It  s a classic now   Anyway  afterwards he discussed it with the audience  And they were talking seriously about the deeper meaning of the wolf   lamb relationship  You people giving this movie a rating of 8 0 in imdb com  you people could be one of them   So let  s say it all together   Hurrz   0 10 Macaulay J  Connor
