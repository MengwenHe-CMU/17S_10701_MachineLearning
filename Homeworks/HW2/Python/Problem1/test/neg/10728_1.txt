See Dick work  See Jane work  Dick and Jane are married  They are successful  They have a son   They have a nice house  They have a Latino housekeeper  The housekeeper teaches Spanish to the son  The son speaks Spanish  Ha-ha  See Dick get promoted  The pompous CEO is a crook  See Dick take the fall for the pompous CEO  Jane quits her job  Oops  See Dick and Jane out of work  Dick   Jane turn to crime  As a plot device  they decide to rob the CEO  See the robbery get botched  See Dick   Jane fund the company's pension plan with the money from the robbery  Yay  See the end credits  Okay  so you've got the plot  Beyond that  Dick and Jane careens from one scene to the next  One barely connecting with the last one or the next one  The whole thing is terribly episodic in nature   Jim Carrey didn't bother to bring his  A  material  he just seems bored and slightly ashamed of the whole thing  But heck  when you're getting paid  20 million plus  why bother  Tea Leoni is frantic  I guess I would be frantic not to get blamed for this flop  There's just something sort of off about Dick   Jane  Carrey and Leoni aren't funny and have little chemistry  The script isn't funny  And it's not well-plotted  But it may be bigger than that  The reality of Dick and Jane is  perhaps  a little too real  Maybe it's just not funny for people to lose their jobs in an Enron-like situation  when real-life still lacks a happy ending
