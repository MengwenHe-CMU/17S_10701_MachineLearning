The worst part of all is the poor scripting  leading to superficial acting  Dreyfuss' character is intensely repetitive and annoying  and Dreyfuss himself has the annoying face to match  Holly Hunter's character is exaggeratedly self-centered  and Hunter herself indulges in serious overacting  as usual  Brad Johnson was wooden  John Goodman made the best of it  Furthermore  the whole death   ghost thing has since been somewhat overdone  and now appears rather lame   Barely watchable only if you like old aeroplanes
