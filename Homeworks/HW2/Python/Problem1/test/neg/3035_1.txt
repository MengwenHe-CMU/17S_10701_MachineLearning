This film really misses the mark on most fronts  The accents are laughably weak  the acting amateurish and the comedy weak at best  They've got a great idea  it could have been particularly enjoyable but for the reasons mentioned above  The writer seems to think by putting the word f ck into every sentence it'll make it funnier and the main character just seems to try a little too hard  He's no Brick top thats for sure  Next time at least get a cast that can keep the accent for the whole film  It's a crime to compare this to films like The Business  Lock Stock and Snatch
