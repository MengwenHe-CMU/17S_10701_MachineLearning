Words cannot express how poor this film is  There is no plot  the acting is appalling  basically the whole film is a joke  With a running time of 97 minutes  it's about 96 minutes too long  It might have been OK as a short sketch on a comedy show  but the premise is way too flimsy to work for that amount of time without boredom kicking in  Avoid this one  go rent a good movie instead
