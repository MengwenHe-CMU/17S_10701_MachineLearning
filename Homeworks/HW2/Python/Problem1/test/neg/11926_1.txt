Right up  or down  there with Toys and Jurassic Park 2 and The Phantom Menace  The premise sounded cool  some of the commercials looked semi-promising  but alas  the entire movie had about 30 seconds of neat shot-ness  and that was shown on the small screen's 30 second slot  If you want amateur writing  second-rate effects  ridiculous costumes  and an all-around snoozefest by all means watch it  The plot is recycled sci-fi fodder  Too bad too  because coming in I thought it would be bad but held out hope  It may be the worst movie I have ever seen  and I have seen a lot   Bottom line - Don't watch it  Unless of course you -liked- any of the above 3 movies
