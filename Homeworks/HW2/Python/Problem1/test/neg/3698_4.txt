This is the kind of movie that BEGS to be shown on TV at 3 or 4 in the morning  if at all  No doubt the film-makers responsible for  Attack of the 50 Foot Woman  thought they were making a pertinent statement about women and philandering and the dangers of the demon rum  all wrapped up in a sci-fi allegory   Or maybe it was a tax write-off  Either way   Attack  proves best for the viewer under the following circumstances  a  extreme intoxication  b  seen on a double-bill with any of those Jacqueline Suzanne movies  maybe  Once is Not Enough    or c  just a night when you feel insecure and the world around you is a little too perfect  Pop in  Attack  and you'll feel great  guaranteed  It's good for a laugh at the expense of the hokey script  the rubbery special FX and that four-eyed sheriff  And I think the last line should be engraved in a monument somewhere in Washington D C  - it's just that memorable  Four stars for  Attack of the 50 Foot Woman   buy a copy  mail it to Gloria Steinem - she'll love you for it
