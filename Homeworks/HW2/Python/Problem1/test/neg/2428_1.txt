Awful  awful  awful    I loved the original film  It was funny  charming  and had heart    this piece of junk has NONE of those things  Reused jokes from the original film  stupid plots  bad animation  different voices  with the exception of Kronk and Yzma  that sound NOTHING like the ones in the original  especially Pacha     shudder    The characters are off model  the animation is flat and boring  it's just a bad job all around  And why is Kuzco a jerk again  I thought he had reformed    but since when are these TV spin offs loyal to the original  rolls eyes   I'm sorry  but there is nothing redeemable about this    at all  Avoid at all costs
