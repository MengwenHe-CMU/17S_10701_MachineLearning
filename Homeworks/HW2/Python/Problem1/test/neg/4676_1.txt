The cast played Shakespeare  Shakespeare lost  I appreciate that this is trying to bring Shakespeare to the masses  but why ruin something so good  Is it because 'The Scottish Play' is my favorite Shakespeare  I do not know  What I do know is that a certain Rev Bowdler  hence bowdlerization  tried to do something similar in the Victorian era  In other words  you cannot improve perfection  I have no more to write but as I have to write at least ten lines of text  and English composition was never my forte I will just have to keep going and say that this movie  as the saying goes  just does not cut it
