 This movie is s   incredibly unfunny it makes any man want to cry  the clich   are put on thicker than 5-year old peanut butter and in such a way that it actually sucks humour out of your heart  every single joke was badly timed and wouldn't have been funny if it were timed correctly  Don't see this movie  there's a real chance you'll never be able to enjoy going to comedies again   ever
