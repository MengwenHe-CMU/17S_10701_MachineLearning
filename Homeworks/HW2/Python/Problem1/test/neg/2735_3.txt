This is a Very Very VERY bad movie   The plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worse  The special effects are unconvincing  The dramatic scenes are a joke  Every step of the way you can see coming a mile away  The end is disappointing and there is no suspense  The best aspect of the film is the soundtrack  The only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a TV movie and i believe the budget was low to start of with  I do believe that the young female fans of Luke Parry will still see this movie however he has done better work  Again this is Terrible  Very very very terrible  If you have a choice  look at something else
