Saw this movie at a Saturday matin  e with a friend  Theater was about 70  full  Although there are quite a few funny lines  it is more of a drama suspense with humor sprinkled on top  Robin Williams gives a decent performance as does Laura Linney  Being a Daily Show fan  Lewis Black is pretty good in this  Christopher Walken gives a good performance also   The movie starts out slow and remains that way for about the first thirty minutes  then the suspense part kicks in and starts keeping you a little on edge throughout the rest of the movie  Suspense in a supposed comedy movie  I know that I  as well as everybody else in the place  was struggling a bit with this  A character would crack a joke during suspense sequence and you would hear just one or two laughs in the theater   In all fairness  after the movie was over there was smattering of applause  So  definitely  some people enjoyed this movie  I gave this movie a four out of ten  because I believe the comedy aspect doesn't work very well in a suspense drama movie and the actors performances  while not bad  were just decent   Again  this movie isn't what was advertised
