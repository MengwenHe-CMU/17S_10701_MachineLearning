It's awful  Pretty succinct review I know  but it has been a long time since a film has left me in such a bewildered state - wondering how the hell a film like that gets made  The last time it happened was last years turkey 'Mission to Mars'  Salvatore Coco is an ex-con - trying to better himself through self help videos  endless seminars and betterment courses  He lives by the catchphrases these courses expound  He stumbles across a washed up nightclub singer  played by Nikki Bennett  and has an epiphany  his new career is going to be that of a talent agent - with the singer as his one and only client  Financed by his gospel singing  paraplegic girlfriend  played by Sasha Horler - he sets up shop and tries to relaunch Nikki's career  with disastarous results  'Walk the Talk' is the reason why Australians are so contemptuous of Australian cinema  It is poorly constructed  lame and way wayyy too long  111 minutes for a comedy that should barely have scraped the 80 minute mark   Every scene is too long  and are very repetitive  The audience is not given a character to empathise with  a vital ingredient in a film like this supposedly about an 'underdog' giving it a go  The downbeat and frankly poor ending comes at the end of 30 minutes of the most mind numbing dialogue and scenes that have you crying out for a power failure  This film is a failure on all levels - made worse for Queensland audiences by its liberal and innacurate use of various Gold Coast Palm Beach location  and its laughable use of Brisbane suburb names like Norman Park and Caboolture
