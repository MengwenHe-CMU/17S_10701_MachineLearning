I gave this a 3 out of a possible 10 stars  Unless you like wasting your time watching an anorexic actress  in this film it's Carly Pope  behaving like a ditz  don't bother  Carly Pope plays Sara Novak  a young college student  who becomes intrigued with a game of riddles  that leads her down into subway tunnels underneath the city - a dangerous thing for even a well-armed man to go in alone  There are various intrigues in the film -- a weirdo classmate who is apparently stalking Sara  a cynical shopkeeper who runs some kind of offbeat hole-in-the-wall establishment that appears to be located in the back alley of a ghetto  a nerdish dim-wit that hangs around the cynic's shop  and a woman named Emily Gray  who is back in prison  Sara's father is a lawyer who is handling Emily Gray's case   A few years back  Emily Gray attempted to drown a 12 year old boy  Emily was put in a mental hospital for 5 years  and for some cockeyed reason they let her out again  even though it is obvious she is still dangerously deranged  The only explanation Emily has ever given for her crime is  I never sinned  It's all part of the design  Well  my friend  don't expect to ever get any better explanation than that  because you won't
