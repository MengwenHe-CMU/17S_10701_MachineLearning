I think it's two years ago since I have seen the movie and till this day it's the worst film I have ever seen  The only thing I thought after seeing this movie was that it was made for some tax reason  So after all this time I finally spilled my gut    And now IMDb says I have to fill 10 lines with comments   Sorry  you must provide at least 10 lines in your comment  Please return to the edit window  or use the BACK option if this isn't a new window    Please there is nothing to say anymore    Sorry for some bad English
