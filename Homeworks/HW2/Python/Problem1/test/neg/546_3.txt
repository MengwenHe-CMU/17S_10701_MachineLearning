The 1935 version of  Enchanted April  manages to be simultaneously tedious and perfunctory  It is difficult to show the transformative magic of Italy shooting in a studio with only stereotypical Italian behavior to belabor  The transformation of the four strangers fleeing London is instantaneous in the cut from the first day to a week later  Rather than develop  the screenplay flips a switch and the characters are different  The husbands are boring enough in flashbacks without turning up  even if their presence does not drive the four women back into their shells and or hostilities  Jessie Ralph has the most fun  moving instead of entirely chewing up the scenery  and Katharine Alexander has some poignant charm out of her husband's shadow  and away from his hideous droning   Ann Harding is unremarkable here  with the Production Code being enforced   She had an appropriate line in an earlier  pre-Code  movie   When Ladies Meet    You're not worth a minute of one anxious hour that either one of us has given you   but in  Enchanted April  can only look hurt  rush out  and proclaim fealty to her errant husband
