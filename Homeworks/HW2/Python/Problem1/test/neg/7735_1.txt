Impressive vision indeed  and some hot chicks with swords flying around  oh and those hypnotic Chinese violins too    Let me think   Crouching Tiger  Hidden Dragon   I kinda liked CTHD  with its down-to-earth simplicity and well developed characters  that still left enough room for you to enjoy the vision without having to think about the DEEEPAA Meaning of it   Hero  on the other hand is painfully pretentious and demanding both visually and conceptually  The larger-than-life moral was horrible  I mean  sacrifice your life  sacrifice your beliefs  sacrifice your love so that your mighty nation can succeed     WTF   No  thanks  But  hay  Mao and G W B  would be proud  Viva
