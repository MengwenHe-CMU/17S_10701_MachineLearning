This is possibly the single worst film i have ever seen - it has no good features at all  It looked as if it was made in about 20 minutes with the other time filled with title graphics  The lead male transformed from deaths door to superman - eh you what Other than that totally predictable and not at all interesting  I left the cinema feeling cheated  Needless to say i could not reccomend this film to anyone
