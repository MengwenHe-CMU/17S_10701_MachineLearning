This movie is just as bad as it gets  If you like logic  or the lack of it     la National Treasure and bad acting as well  then it could be a movie for you  Otherwise spend your time in the sun and your money on a beer  Actually it looks like a bad produced promo or demo picture to promote the people involved  ie  actors  special effects and so on   Accidentially they produce really bad exposing of their lack of talent  In a case like this the film company should be ordered to pay back money to the costumers that are not satisfied with the product  It is really lousy
