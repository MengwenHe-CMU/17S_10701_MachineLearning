Any of Law   Order's  CSI  take your choice of city   and Homicide  Life on the Street's weakest episodes is superior to the strongest episode of Bones  David Boreanaz is stuck in crappy Angel mode  and Emily Deschanel portrays  Bones  too    unrealistically  The actors as a whole have terrible scenes together  be it with forced acting  or just awful lines  The murders become predictable after a while  as the foreshadowing and clues are just too obvious  Music is okay  though really unnecessary at times  All in all  Bones is hardly the show I'd recommend watching during the weekdays as it is a carbon-copy of better shows with unreal characters and ever-dulling stories  Skip this if you can
