The movie isn't too bad  up until    The main problem is with the ending  so it's a pretty major spoiler    For the time it was made  it's a beautiful movie  and does get a lot of it right  However    In the book  Sam succeeds and lives his dream  whereas in the movie  he gives up and goes back to the city  completely destroying the  you can do what you put your mind to  theme of the book  This movie is a desecration  and instead of remaking classics that don't need redone  the Hollywood types who haven't any better ideas should do this one  right this time
