Sorry  after watching the credits  I thought this would at least be a decent homage to retiring SF actors  Boy was I wrong  The direction and story telling in this POS are terrible  I have never been so insulted by a production  I have great respect and love for many of the actors in this  film  but have to say they were conned  If you haven't seen this debacle yet  do yourself a favor and stay away  These are not only two hours you won't get back  but they will also ruin your respect for some actors you may once have enjoyed
