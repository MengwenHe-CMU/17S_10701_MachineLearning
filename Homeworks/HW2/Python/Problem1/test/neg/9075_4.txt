I chose this movie because I was looking for a triangle friendship between a girl   two boys  As I lived this situation and get lost in it  I hope a similar story would inspire me   My major concerns are  - Why  a    How  b  the triangle forms   - Why  c    How  d  the triangle degenerates    a  The movie offers a plain answer   because it's better       b  here  it's an open triangle  the three share things together  Mine was a closed one  every ones knows the others but never the three are together or speak about the missing one    c  The movie doesn't offer spoken explanations but rather prefer visual   emotional assumptions  the end comes with sensuality  sexuality coming up in the triangle  or more accurately  when for one member  deep feelings are tied with intimacy  and  as for the latter and the former  they can be divided  I agree with that   d  In the movie   in my story  silence is the proof that something isn't well   And in a ironic and painful way  the tool for this sad times  is always the phone  I lived this dreadful planned phone-call   Call me back  I wait you    and when time comes  the phone is silent    A variation is also shown  when the line is connected but one refuses to speak   All those scenes were very very hard to see for me  If the movie was a great help in that way  he got also a lot of flaws  - I zapped on the boy's family problems - why the shower scene on the DVD cover is cut on the movie   - how Mickael gets finally into the hotel    - is Cl  ment always seeing Salom     he says  no  but has her address  and who is the girl with him in the bar  his girlfriend   how can she knows about the address     - what finally happens to Vanessa  the ring at the final shoot is a proof of engagement     with whom
