I never want to see this movie again  Not only is it dreadfully bad  but I can't stand seeing my hero Stan Laurel looking so old and sick  Mostly I can't stand watching this terrible movie  Frankly  there is no reason to watch this awful film  The plot is just plain stupid  The actors that surround Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are really really bad and Laurel and Hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films   I warn you don't watch it  the images will haunt you for a long while to come
