Greetings from Lithuania  This is the first question that comes to head after watching this  movie    You know  I saw a lot of bad movies in my life  but after watching this one  i only had two questions  1  Is this was just a parody  spoof   2  How could people create such a thing    If You never saw this  film   than you REALLY don't know what is a REALLY bad  film   I mean BAD  The script - Are you kidding my  Acting is so horrible that i thing  the actors  where just having fun in this movie  I know  this is  B  movie  but come on   Is this have to be a reason to be such a garbage    Oh  And what an ending    A must miss ending  Just when you thing that this is the worst thing you have ever saw  wait until the ending - because THAT kind of ending You have NEVER saw before  and I hope You will never see    Awoid this  movie  at any cost  and don't say i didn't warn you
