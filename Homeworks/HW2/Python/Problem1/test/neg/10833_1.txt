Even a awful 1 is to much for this film  everything form start to finish made you cringe  I don't think it would be possible to cram more overly clich  d moments  into one piece of mind numbingly numbingly waste of film  Prisoner cell block H meets Thunderbirds  hell even Virgil's expressions were more life like than his son  I haven't even finished watching this and I'm on here now     Oh no  the cheesy clapping of 3 actors and a backdrop done by a child with adobe premiere  This truly is the end of my  I've started so I'll finish watching it  phase  Oh joy  the credits have come to rescue me   and relax
