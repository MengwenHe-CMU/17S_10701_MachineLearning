J J  Jameson  from Spiderman 2  Quote     Crap  Crap      Mega-Crap It pretends to be an homage  un intentional  to the Coen Brothers     done poorly  There is no real mystery to the plot  Diaz's performance is totally uninspired  The quirky characters don't really work  There are a lot of  duh  moments  I love black comedy  but this film isn't funny  In my view  it wasn't worth the electricity  There are many films in this genre which are much more entertaining  I hope you find this review helpful
