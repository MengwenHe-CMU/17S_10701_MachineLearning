This movie is a shameful result of what happens when  A  It is written  directed and produced by an idiot  and or B  It was rushed in production to satiate the poker Stu Ungar craze   The story from beginning is uneven  Vidmer spends too much time on Ungar's childhood and not enough on some of the legendary tales -- such as counting cards  his blackjack escapades  the roll of money as id  He also leaves out mentions of other poker greats such as chip reese  brunson etc  The movie is a complete mess from beginning to end   If you want a more complete and accurate account  read the book One of a Kind  If you thought the movie was good  read the book and change your mind
