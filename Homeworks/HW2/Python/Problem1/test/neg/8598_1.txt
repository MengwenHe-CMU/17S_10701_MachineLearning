The unfunniest so called comedy I've ever seen Not a patch on the naturalism of the hilariously dare Twin Town Vegas I  like normally but this script is so dire so predictable so well English in the worst way  In recent years the English films have been awful all of them  Ireland at least produced the commitments  Scotland with Braveheart and Trainspotting 2 stand out great movies and Wales had Twin Town  Zulu  Last Days of Dolwyn   Torchwood  Doctor Who and Under Milk Wood etc The comedy is paint by numbers  the actors are dead men walking because there is no characterisation and no originality and it's just so unfunny England is falling behind no matter how many grim up north movies they produce  It's the old class system that destroys English films  The Oxbridge graduates spewing endlessly clich  d scripts about working class people they've never lived with  It is pathetic  Monty Python wasn't funny  neither was anything from Oxbridge  Let guys like Jonny Vegas and Peter Kay  Rob Brydon  Billy Connolly or write their own dialogue and forget the archaic failed class system let the working class people and the real talent that comes through the system properly take over the writing and the British and English film industries will rise again what next prince Edward to write a modern day Oliver Twist
