wow  it's even better than I expected  the best animated Ast  rix movie ever  and it feels so good to hear Roger Carel doing the voice of Ast  rix again  I surely recommend it to everyone who likes the comic books of Ast  rix  but I suggest that you go to see the french version  cause it surely is the best and you hear the original cast  did you know that Roger Carel has played Ast  rix for nearly forty years  i think he did a marvelous job  and the song from C  line Dion at the end fits rally good to the end credits  the music is good  the drawings are good  the actors are wonderful    in a word  a masterpiece  go to see it  you will not regret this
