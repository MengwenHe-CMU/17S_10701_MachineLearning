Even a bad Julie Andrews Musical is worth watching and this isn't bad  In fact it's quite entertaining  Actually it's a fascinating study on trying to manipulate a star's personae  To break Julie's  goody two shoes mold  she plays a German Spy English Musical Hall Actress  She subsequently went on to take her top off in the movie S O B  and play a drag queen in Victor Victoria and other not so goody girls usually under hubby Blake Edward's direction  The movie is admittedly problematic It is hard to feel for her character because she's a German Spy  We want to love Julie but she's on the wrong side of the law  Probably this is why this movie flopped  Julie as a German Spy  Our Mary Poppins  our Maria Van Trapp suddenly a German Spy  The romance seems to happen overnight and come from nowhere  But never mind  it's a musical and it has Jullie  Oh and did I mention hunky Rock Hudson is in it too  Julie gives a glowing wonderful performance that any musical comedy buff should not miss  Great WW 1 Songs and nice tunes by Mancini  Yes the film has plot holes and at times doesn't seem logical  For example  why is Julie and her uncle suddenly pursued by the Germans when a minute ago she was spying for them   But on another note  who cares  The musical numbers are fun and exciting  The costumes and scenery extraordinarily lavish  The cinematography quite on the mark  It has the annoying idiot detectives that Blake Edwards puts in all his movies   Yawn  But it has Julie- trying desperately to change her image   You can imagine dinner with Blake and Julie - Julie   Blake we need to change my image    Blake   I Will make you a German Spy  then we will take your clothes off in another movie and then play a transvestite in a another movie  They won't recognize you  It will be the death of Maria Von Trapp  Fascinating study on changing an image  Wonderful Julie  A must see for musical comedy buffs  Much more entertaining than Star
