I was very impressed with this film from newcomer Dir  Writer Jose Reyes  The cast was excellent   Jorge Cordoba  executed a powerful and shocking performance as the lead character of  Rafa   It's inspiring to see independent films with this level of talent   It takes talent  courage  and determination to go out and make a quality film  I admire anyone who can take an idea from concept to conception and go the mile   It's easy for people to judge young filmmakers more harshly  but I applaud  Jose Reyes   and the talented cast for their successful efforts
