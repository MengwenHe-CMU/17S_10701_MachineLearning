I have seen most of the Tarzan episodes  Certainly the rated X with O'Keeffe   Bo Derek  which is totally deplorable  I have seen this version several times since it was originally shown  All the cast had memorable parts  great acting the Ape sequences  Last night I viewed same on Spanish station and other than some French dialog all in Spanish  As far as Hudson not wanting Andie's voice he did nothing until the very end  He viewed the dailies and could have hired a dialog coach  It seems silly that a story about apes and a man raised by them all speaking gibberish that Hudson attacked Andie The story line in the movie was that she was an American cousin  The last time I checked Carolina was in the USA  She was beautiful in movie and her eyes  and gorgeous hair  alabaster skin mystified all us males  She did not have to resort to Bo's level  She has remained a LADY throughout the rest of her career and should look at this movie  half her life ago  as a starting point  Her performance  sincerity  made this movie enjoyable  believable that a half wild man could ascertain her inner beauty  Great sending point for Sir Richardson  he did steal the movie
