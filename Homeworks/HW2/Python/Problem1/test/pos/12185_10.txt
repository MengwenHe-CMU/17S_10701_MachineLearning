okay    first to Anne rice BOOK fans     sure lestat's eyes are not blue   sure he isn't blond in this movie    but even though Marius is not lestat's maker   even though they COMPLETELY altered the story      how can u say its not a good movie   this movie   is the BEST vampire movie i ever saw   and lestat is pictured perfectly in it    maybe not his features   but i don't think one can find a better lestat    the way he speaks   and the way he looks at mere mortals   his arrogance  and sheer love for fame is pictured flawlessly  if u for once   consider it just a movie  and not try and relate every scene to the book   u will love the movie as much as i do  now   to the non readers   be prepared to fall absolutely in love with this movie    it has every thing    and the goth music   is like an added treat    the dialogues   are beautiful   and catching   and even though its a vampire movie  u will find yourself smiling   at the wit of the characters   and u will find yourself sympathizing with the vampires   overall   one of my fav movies     10 10
