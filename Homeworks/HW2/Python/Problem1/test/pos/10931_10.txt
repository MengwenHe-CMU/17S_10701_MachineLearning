I have just read what I believe to be an analysis of this film by a lyrical Irishman  Lovely to read  However  a concise analysis of this film is that it is a interweaving of the seven deadly sins with the four types of justice  Envy  greed  pride  sloth  anger  etc  and justice in the forms of retributive  distributive  blind  and divine  I could demonstrate three examples of each  one for each of the three protagonists  however  it is much more fun to note them for oneself  This is an excellent film  Don't miss it
