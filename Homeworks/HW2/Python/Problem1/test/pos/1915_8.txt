What a trip down memory lane  Do not look for great acting  believable plot lines  or anything resembling a quality movie  This is pure blaxploitation at it's finest  Outrageous outfits  unrepeatable dialog  objectification of women  and the sleaziest cops you can imagine  This vanity piece by the  Godfather of Rap   Rudy Ray Moore  who left us for good last week is the standard by which all blaxploitation is measured  You not only see blaxploitation at it's finest  but get glimpses of his comedy genius  and see why his records were kept under the counter
