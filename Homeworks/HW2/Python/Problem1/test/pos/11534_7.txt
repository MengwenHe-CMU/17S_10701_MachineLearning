So it isn't an epic  but for people experiencing anything similar  sibling suicide  it might be an interesting way of therapy  An imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well spent  For some reason  it hasn't really caught on in the audience  something I do believe is a result of the main theme  Why did she commit suicide  Clearly  this is hardly something that US moviegoers will flock to  had it been an European production it probably would have reached its audience in a much greater extent  It is however  a movie that although the realism tainted by a shimmering romanticized glow  gives the viewer a whole hearted impression
