The jazz soundtrack makes this seem like a Clint Eastwood movie  In fact the whole thing strikes me as Burt doing Clint  The story is good and the movie is full of one liners that I carry with me to this day   Reynolds to bad guy  I'm gonna pull the chain on you pal  because you're f'n up my town  And you wanna know the worst part  You're from outta state   Highlights  The Technics 1500B reel to reel is nice set dressing for audiophiles  Charles Durning coming unglued while listening to wiretap tapes of prostitutes having  sort of  phone sex   You'd have to see it  trust me  it's hilarious   Brian Keith plays against type as a tough guy   And does it well   Bernie Casie's preoccupation with Zen  Rachel Ward  WOW   Where'd she go   Doc Severinsen and the Tonight Show band play their rears off as usual   Joe William's guests on vocals  Manhattan Transfer re-recorded  Route 66    The soundtrack lends class to the whole affair  Need I say more  It might be Reynold's best film ever    Yeah  he plays himself  as usual  but it works   Enjoy
