First off- What are some of you thinking  This is the best movie I've seen in ages   Secondly- I don't think of it as a British movie as it is set in Dublin and has mainly Irish actors- Moran  Gambon  Aisling O Sullivan Rita   Deirdre O'Kane etc  Thirdly- I thought that Moran was excellent  He was hilariously funny through out  Micheal Caine seemed only to be there to get Moran context  Each character he took on he perfected   Abigail Iversen I thought was better than any other child actor I have seen  She was believable as the smart kid and also as a kid and an adult yes I know that sounds strange but hey      Even she managed to upstage Caine   Iversen and Moran worked very well together and were very funny in the preparation scene  Barreler Gambon  was very funny in his ineptitude
