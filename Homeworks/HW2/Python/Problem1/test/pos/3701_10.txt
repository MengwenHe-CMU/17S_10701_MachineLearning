It's 3 30am  I just saw this movie about six minutes ago and it is fantastic  A teenage girl has a night of passion with her mom's lover and it ruins everybody's lives  The really interesting thing about this movie is that you can't really place the blame on any one person  Everyone performed perfectly  and the story was thought-provoking  You should definitely see this movie if you can get your hands on it  I give it a 10
