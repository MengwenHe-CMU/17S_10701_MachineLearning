The plot line is an expose of the under belly of American politics  While the theme seems common  what  makes  the movie is the unconventional way the story is told  The characters are played with conviction  You feel the innocence of the lead  and his innocence lost  The politician is the prince of double-talk  a real snake  The camera work is impressive  It affirms the nuances of the acting and dialogue  Ditto for the music  The story uses a parable-style with vingettes where the message is filled with double-entendres  A very canny strategy by the writer director  The tension in the storyline is carried through to the last scenes  The movie was like a good mystery book  Something was  afoot   you knew it was bad  you didn't know exactly what it could be - you had your suspicions  and when the evil was revealed you let out your breath you hadn't noticed you were holding in  Saddened  shaking your head  A story well written and well told  3 cheers to a young writer director
