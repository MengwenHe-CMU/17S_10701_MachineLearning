This movie is one of my favorite comedies of all time  The dialog is crisp  the pace is fast  Not only is this a clever comedy  this is an interesting look at what goes on behind the scenes in the television news business  There are so many funny lines   a couple of my favorites  Ernie Merriman   sarcastically  It must be nice to always believe you know better  to always think you're the smartest person in the room  Jane   seriously  NO  it's not  it's awful   Aaron  He must be good looking Jane  How do you know that  Aaron  No one invites a bad looking idiot to their room  The performances of Holly Hunter  Albert Brooks  and William Hurt were absolutely brilliant  Even years later  I remember this movie well  Often forgotten is the wonderfully funny Joan Cusack  I love the scene where the newsroom personnel are racing to beat a deadline  There are so many funny scenes that it's hard to pick a favorite  I highly recommend this film
