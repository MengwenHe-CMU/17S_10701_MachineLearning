Biographical tale of the life of Charles Lindbergh  the first man to fly solo non-stop across the Atlantic in 1927  aboard his plane the Spirit of St Louis  While not amongst Director Billy Wilder's best films it does boast some very impressive production values especially for a film made 50 years ago  The story is well told and the performances are also good though not outstanding  One definite limiting factor upon the storytelling is that Lindbergh flew alone and without a radio  which meant he has no one to speak with  This necessitated a few different story telling techniques such as internal monologues  speaking with a housefly  and the occasional bouts of talking to himself especially once the exhaustion sets in  Also in order to avoid an extended sequence of the famous flight  it is interspersed with flashbacks from his life and the methodical preparations for the flight  Charles Lindbergh was a huge hero of his era but his controversial beliefs would taint his legacy somewhat  Despite this he would continue to contribute to the aviation field and assisted as a civilian aircraft consultant to the US effort in WWII  Jimmy Stewart certainly had the flying background to back his portrayal of Lindbergh  He rose to the rank of Colonel in US Air Force during WWII and while in the reserves following the War would reach the rank of Brigadier General
