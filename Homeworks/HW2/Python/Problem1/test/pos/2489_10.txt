Punishment Park is a brilliant piece of cinema  Shot in the Southern California desert using his patent faux documentary style  Watkins creates a film like no other  He follows two groups of prisoners  one pre-sentenced the other post-sentenced  throughout the picture  After  they're tried by a military tribunal  they have the choice of either serving out a prison sentence or they can participate in Punishment Park  a grueling three day hike through the desert with nothing but the clothes on their backs  whilst being hunted down by local law enforcement officers who use the park as a live action training ground   I can't say enough about this movie  Sometimes it feels as if you're watching a real documentary  This is one of Peter Watkins most accessible films  I advise you to look out for it  You wont regret it  Highly recommended A
