Come on  Anyone who doesn't understand the greatness of this here cartoon should be kicked off any critic's panel  They should not be allowed to be heard  because they obviously have no sense of humor whatsoever   Anyone who does not love this here animated cartoon directed by Tex Avery should be chained to a chair and forced to watch  Huckleberry Hound  episodes for 20 years straight   The takes and double-takes by the Wolf in this cartoon are the finest examples of this important past of comedy that have ever been captured on film   Tex Avery should receive a posthumous Academy Award for this cartoon  It's the best
