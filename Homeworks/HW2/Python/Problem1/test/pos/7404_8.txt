Sometimes good things happen by accident  I'd never heard of  Silverwing  until late 2005--I was flipping channels and happened to see something on Toon Disney with bats in a sawmill being attacked by owls  I had no idea what it was  but I was motivated to stay tuned--it was hard waiting for a commercial so I could find out what it was called  Part of what intrigued me was the looks of the bats--first of all  they didn't use the popular convention of giving the bats  extra fingers  where their thumb claws are supposed to be  Rather  they have palms like human hands  but the fingers are longer and have webs of skin between them  Also the faces--they look like human beings  in fact  at one point I wondered if they had once been human but were transformed INTO bats   Ordinarily I don't like this in cartoon animals  but it worked here--the story is a human story  even though it's about bats and other animals  not unlike The Lion King   What I saw on TV were the last two parts of the  trilogy   I'd missed the very beginning of the first one   Towers of Fire   the second overall   but for the most part I saw all of each of them  However  I found myself wanting to understand what was going on  since the first part hadn't been on and I wouldn't have caught it anyway  But I saw that it was based on a book by Kenneth Oppel  How fortunate that I paid attention and wrote it down--I was very disappointed when I learned that the series WASN'T AVAILABLE  It wasn't even that recently made that it made sense for it not to be available yet  However  I did find not only the book Silverwing  but also the two sequels Sunwing and Firewing  When I read the first book  I was left wondering  Is that it   Not only because a lot of what's in the series isn't in that book  but even had I not seen the animated version  the book Silverwing  otherwise a good story  doesn't end so much as it stops  Only one loose end is tied up--Shade and Marina meet the Silverwing colony at Hibernaculum  In fact  Silverwing and Sunwing should have  in my opinion  been published in a single volume  because they make for a complete story together  but not separately  Actually  the animated version takes some elements from Sunwing  e  g   Orestes  the lifting of the ban from seeing the sun  and some were completely original  It's not perfect  but it's definitely very enjoyable  I enjoy both versions of the Silverwing saga  Which is why I'm glad it's finally going to be available in June  It was a long time coming  and it's well worth the wait
