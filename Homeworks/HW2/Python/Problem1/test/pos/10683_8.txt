Fans of Gerry Anderson's productions will recognise several actors and vehicles from UFO  which was made after Doppelg  nger  - as well as sound effects from various Anderson series  Barry Gray's excellent music  mostly unique to this film  adds to the feeling of familiarity  For these reasons alone  I think any Gerry Anderson fan would find Doppelg  nger worth getting  Judged simply as a film  it has to be said that Doppelg  nger is flawed  It is known that there were major problems during production  and I suspect this is why there is a time-consuming plot thread that ends abruptly and appears to have no relevance to the rest of the story  Presumably time budget constraints prevented the relevance from emerging  Distractingly  the special effects range from outstandingly good - better than any 1960s film that I know of - to disappointingly bad   Nevertheless  even with these flaws  Doppelg  nger's main story is well told and keeps the viewer  or  at least  this viewer  engaged throughout  The ending is perhaps not what one might expect from Anderson  yet at the same time it is typical of Anderson  and it is certainly appropriate  To find out what I mean you'll have to watch it for yourself
