Very touching film  a great surprise to come up from Brazil  a country that usually exports features about social themes  violence  sex    Magical realism is a very hard task  and I believe Jo  o Falc  o has made it wonderfully  It seems that he really didn't intend to make a realistic film  far from that  Although many people think the film was adapted from the play  he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book  Another mistake is to think that Falc  o has been influenced by the series  Hoje    Dia De Maria   The TV series produced by Globo was made after the film  but aired before    Unfortunately  The negative point is the photography  by Walter Carvalho  It seems that he didn't capture or understand the concept Falc  o has created  The story is captivating and universal  in spite of taking place in a tiny little city in Brazil  That could take place anywhere in the world  A great movie  I strongly recommend
