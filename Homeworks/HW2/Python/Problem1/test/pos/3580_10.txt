An stunning look at the ocean and the life in it  The Good  The camera work was absolutely phenomenal  Every shot is done beautifully  It was interesting seeing all the different animals that I could have never even imagined  David Attenborough has the perfect narrator's voice  No one could have done any better  The Bad  There were one or two different times where there was a reference to the Earth being 1 million years old   I hold a different belief    Overall a TV series anyone can enjoy  I highly recommend buying it  10 10 stars
