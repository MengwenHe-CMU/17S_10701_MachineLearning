Okay  I think we're all agreed that Michael Jackson was the low point  And the special effects too  But  please  keep in mind that this was NOT a big-budget film  okay  Not every film gets as much of a budget as Harry Potter or Star Wars  However  I thought it was pretty funny altogether  B-  Nothing that would  in my opinion  waste your time  Parodies are always fun to watch  and just because it wasn't big budget doesn't mean it's bad  I think this was a good movie  if weak at some points  Hope this comment helps   Angela
