There was a video out in America called 'Cartoon Scandals' that featured about an hours worth of banned cartoons  Most of them were WWII era  That's where I first saw  and heard of  this one  The rooster during the opening news broadcast turns into a vulture with an Asian face saying 'cock-a-doodle-doo please ' After that it's eight minutes of propaganda played out like a newsreel  Viscously racist  but when you look at it as the piece of history it is  it can  and should  be forgiven  Slicing ration cards to make sandwiches  Showing the ruins of Rome while calling Moussolini 'Ruin  1 ' A minesweeper using a broom  A manned bomb with the pilot saying 'RET ME OUT OF HERE '  And of course the stereotyping  Every Japanese was drawn with big teeth  constantly bowing  and saying 'please' at the end of every broken sentence  The funniest bit  The air raid siren that was two bowing men stabbing each other in the tush with pins   oooo-OOOOOO   Hey AOL  Let this one out  It deserves notice  My wife laughed at this  And she's 100  Japanese
