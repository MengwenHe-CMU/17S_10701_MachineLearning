I watched this movie on HBO and I had a good time  The director has done a great work  I found myself totally absorbed into this movie once it started  Norman Reedus's performance is cool  I expect more chilling movies from him  I was so absorbed that on occasions I wanted to grab gun from Norman and shoot that snake girl  Hehe  I like the movies when innocent looking girls play tricks with men really cunningly  The ending was what I wanted      This movie is filled with twists of moments  You expect this but something else happens   In the beginning  those massive images cut scenes were really painful to eyes  Although it was not shown when Norman Reedus changed currency notes  Or is it me standing by fridge
