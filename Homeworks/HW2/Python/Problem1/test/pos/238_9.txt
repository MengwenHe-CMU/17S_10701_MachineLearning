Long ago and far away they knew how to make a musical and  Cover Girl  is no exception to the rule  A story of a dancer in a nightclub who becomes a cover girl and famous  The old adage applies here- that happiness and fame always don't mix  The dance routines are marvelously choreographed  What dancing and chemistry between Rita Hayworth and Gene Kelly  Otto Kruger is the older gentleman who discovers Hayworth  when he sees her picture that shows a strong resemblance to the woman who left him at the aisle-Hayworth's grandmother Maribel  A jealous reaction by Kelly drives Rusty  Hayworth  into the arms of Broadway producer Lee Bowman  The picture is basically history repeating itself at the end  To add to the glory of this fine film  there is the always wise-cracking Eve Arden and the hilarious Phil Silvers  appropriately named Genius in the film
