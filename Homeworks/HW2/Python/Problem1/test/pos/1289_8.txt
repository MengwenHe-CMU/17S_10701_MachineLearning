Christopher Nolan's first directorial effort  a year before he did  Memento   and this is almost as brilliant as that classic  He uses time differentials in a similar manner to tell his story  and it's a very clever one  Bill is this young writer who begins following complete strangers around just to see where they live and what they're all about  One day  he follows this man  Cobb  who turns the tables and confronts Bill  who breaks down and confesses what he's up to   Cobb is a burglar and he takes Bill along on a few jobs to teach him the ropes  Both men are voyeurs of a sort and a bond begins to grow between the two of them   But there's an ulterior motive for Cobb nurturing this relationship  and it all ties in very smartly at the end  No  I won't spoil it but this is a very cool movie and I'm beginning to think Christopher Nolan is a genius  If you like suspense films with surprise endings  this one is a must see
