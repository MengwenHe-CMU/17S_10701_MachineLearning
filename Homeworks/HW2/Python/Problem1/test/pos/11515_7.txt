This is an important historical film since it was the the first all-talking feature film   The film was made for a mere 23 000 dollars  It grossed over a million dollars upon its release   This film all so helped define the gangster melodramas that were to become the bread and butter of the Warner's studio in the 1930's   The popularity of this film ended the silent era more so than its more famous part-talkie predecessor  the Jazz Singer  The film deserves its place in history and not as a mere footnote   The only actor who might be remember today that is in it was Eugene Palette
