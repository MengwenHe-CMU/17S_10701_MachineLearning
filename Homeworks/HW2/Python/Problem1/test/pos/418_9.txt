This is NOT your run-of-the mill police story where the characters were only secondary to the gun battles and car chases  The episodes  so far  are more realistic and intelligent  If you are looking for something with a lot of butt-kicking Rambo-style cop story  you will not find it here  I gave it a 9  I wish this series lives long  Morse is excellent
