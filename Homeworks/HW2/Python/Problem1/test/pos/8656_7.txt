Enjoyed 'Den brysomme mannen' http   ow ly PTTp  my wife didn't  so I watched it in bits over a few days   Reviewers mainly confused - most agree it's allegorical  but not of what  'Heaven'  'Hell'  'Socialism'  'Capitalism'   That most people don't wish to escape  and it's  essentially  forbidden goes with most of those options  So  presumably you're supposed to project your favourite preoccupation prejudice fear onto it   So I'd say it's about an a-epicurean life  A live desaturated of colour  literally in the film  figuratively in the interpretation
