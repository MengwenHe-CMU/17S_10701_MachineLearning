It is the best movie released in Bollywood upto date  The best comedy  the best acting and the best direction till now  Rajkumar Santoshi's writing and direction proved that he is one of the best directors in the industry  Aamir Khan was absolutely amazing  Salman Khan looked good the way he acted  Shakti Kapoor was good  but Jagdeep over acted as usual  This comedy is still copied by people and no other writers and directors have been able to make this thing again  Even Rajkumar Santoshi hasn't been able to make this cult classic again  This movie was a flop when it released but it has been a cult classic since it released and loved by all kinds of people  STAR  ACTING 10 10  DIALOGUES 10 10  SCREENPLAY 10 10  DIRECTION 10 10  MUSIC 9 10  LYRICS 9 10  Overall  This movie is strongly recommended  If you didn't watch it till now  you missed something big  It is a laugh riot and the best comedy i have seen till date  Classic Films like Hera Pheri  Golmaal and Jaane Bhi Do Jaaro are not even half as funny as this  GREAT MOVIE  HATS OFF
