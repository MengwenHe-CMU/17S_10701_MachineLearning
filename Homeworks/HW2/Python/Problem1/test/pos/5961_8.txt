Excellent exercise on multiple plans  - showing the not yet ended colonialism spirit in France  - more generally the boring mindset of superiority from all western people - a renewal of the spy and thriller movies  OSS 117 is uncultured and stupid  The good idea is that  in spite of all these messages  it is a funny film  plenty of jokes and gags  very light and sparkling  Special mention to Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo  Definitely worth seeing  Wonder how it will be appreciated in US  Seems to be a success in France  so probably a next version will come
