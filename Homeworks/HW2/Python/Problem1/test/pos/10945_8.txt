With a film starring the Twins  Ekin Cheng and Edison Chen  nobody should expect a masterpiece of cinema  What you do get  however  is a fun film which is easy on the eye and the brain  There are loads of Hollywood-style vampires  no hopping Chinese bloodsuckers here   cute girls  handsome heroes and the occasionally very funny moment  And Jackie Chan  Sure  the kung-fu relies heavily on wire work and CGI  Sure  the script reminds you of Blade  And sure  the whole affair is instantly forgettable  But for a truly enjoyable piece of cinematic fluff  you would be hard pushed to find better
