I think this TV film was first aired the same week that Manchester Utd played in the Champions League Final  1999   they run a lot of football related items that week and this one was an absolute standout  It played on all the clich  s that are churned out every season during the FA Cup ie  plucky underdogs  lucky clothing mascots  name on the cup etc and turned out to be brilliantly funny  I'm surprised it has never been repeated prior to other big football occasions  even now with the world cup just getting underway   A few previous posts from non-football fans have said they still love it  but a football fan will find it hilarious imho
