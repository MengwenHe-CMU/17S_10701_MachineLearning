10 respected directors each shot a short film with operatic arias as the inspiration  and music   I'll do each one separately  Nicolas Roeg  dir --Giuseppe Verdi  music   A story about an assassination attempt in 1931 Vienna  Theresa Russell  Roegs wife  plays a man  Not bad--very beautiful and exotic  Russell is great  Charles Sturridge--Verdi  No story but there is some haunting black and white imagery that fits perfectly with the music  Jean-Luc Godard--Jean Baptiste Lully  Horrendous  Pointless  boring  no plot  no nothing  Filled with gratuitous female nudity  The worst  Julien Temple--Verdi  Buck Henry  Beverly D'Angelo and Anita Morris star in this funny  if obvious  story about a cheating couple  Pretty good  Bruce Beresford--Erich Korngold  Short  lush and romantic  Very good  Robert Altman--Jean-Philippe Rameau  Dull  A yawner  Fran Roddam--Richard Wagner  This has Bridget Fonda in her film debut  Beautifully done love story with a fairly explicit sex scene   Ken Russell--Giacomo Puccini  Really strange but OK  Derek Jarman--Gustave Chapentier  Lyrical look at youth and old age  Very sweet   The last is by Bill Bryden doing  I Pagliacci   He has John Hurt     dressed as a clown lip-syncing to Caruso        When this came out it almost got an X rating  for the abundant nudity and the sex scene   It was given an R with a strict warning attached saying the R rating would be heavily enforced  After the film bombed that warning disappeared  The idea isn't bad and 6 out of the 10 segments were worthwhile  Worth seeing even if you don't like opera  Just avoid the Godard segment  I'm giving it an 8
