Although the wonderful soda counter in the local drugstore no longer exists  and the clothes are definitely l946 immediate post-war vintage  and good and evil are easy to understand  and those old planes are really dated  this movie will never be dated   The human adjustments and problems post-war  the beautiful love stories  the wonderful acting  especially Harold Russell and Dana Andrews  are as moving today in 2002 as they were in l946   I was one of the young women who welcomed our marvelous veterans home from World War II  Like so many  my memories of the war years and the homecomings are as fresh today as if they took place yesterday - this movie is very relevant for our times
