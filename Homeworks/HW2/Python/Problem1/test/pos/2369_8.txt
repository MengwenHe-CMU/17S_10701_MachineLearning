I taped this on Sundance and had no idea that it was a Miike film  I thought it was just another kung fu movie  Then I saw things like the dancing sax player  who sounded like an Oriental Gato Barbieri  and I knew this had to be Miike  I missed the beginning opening credits and had to wait till the very end of the closing credits to see Miike's credits  So far he hasn't disappointed me yet  Audition  City of Lost Souls  Ichi the Killer and The Happiness of the Katakuries were all good flicks  and now I've found out that this was the third in a trilogy  Other than Miike and Todd Solendz there's nobody making interesting films nowadays
