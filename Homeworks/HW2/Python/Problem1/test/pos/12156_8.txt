 More   maybe  is mostly remembered for the excellent soundtrack composed by Pink Floyd -in 1969 they weren't superstars yet  Actually they made an album with the film music  no fan can miss it  But this is also the first film of German-French director Barbet Schroeder  it's a cult movie  When it was released  censorship everywhere cut several scenes of sex and drugs  It is also one of the first films to treat explicitly the theme of drug slavery  A German boy travels to Paris and meets an American girl  they fall in love  Together they search for sun and exoticism  But it's a too high price love  she initiates him into drugs  In the Sixties anti-drug campaigns were not like today  there wasn't much information  On the contrary  in many milieus taking drugs was a sort of spiritual experience    So it's quite surprising to see a film of that period which describes a nightmarish heroin experience  The film is simple  not vulgar at all and shot in a  cinema-verit    style  Actors Mimsy Farmer and Klaus Gr  nberg are very convincing   More  is a document of the end of the Sixties -and a document of the end of the hippies illusions as well
