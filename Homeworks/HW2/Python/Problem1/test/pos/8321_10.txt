and quite frankly that just sums it up  It is a small computer animated series that is filmed just like an animal documentory     The animation is almost flawless  I thought the long necked swimming dinosaurs eyes looked fake   However some of the model shots didn't look quite that realistic    and I thought that Jurrassic park made a better T Rex   If this is the type of thing we see on a normal British TV series then I cannot wait to see what they can accomplish in the movies   I give this 10 10 stars     and the  making of  video was also great     the dinosaur on the skate board was halarious
