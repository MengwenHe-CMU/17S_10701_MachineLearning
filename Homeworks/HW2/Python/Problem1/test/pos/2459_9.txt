 Emilio Estevez takes the wonderful play HOMEFRONT and makes it into an engaging movie  THE WAR AT HOME has an exceptionally strong cast -- all seemingly digging deep into their characters  The acting here is TOP NOTCH  Credit must also go to director Emilio Estevez  The visual transitions between past and present were ultra smooth  The sound effects during the battle scenes were chilling and effectively added to the tension  Remove all of the Viet Nam elements from the story  and still left would be interesting characters wrestling with the good and bad of the full range of family dynamics   A viewer might see this point more clearly by keeping in mind the  discovering the old photo  scene from the beginning as the rest of the movie is watched   As a movie  I found THE WAR AT HOME to be more direct and to the point than BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY  A fine effort -- almost a 10
