I saw this movie at the Locarno Film Festival in Italian-speaking part of Switzerland  Aishwarya Rai is good-looking  I rate this movie 7 10 because of its nice moments    spoilers ahead   It has some really nice cinematic moments in it  specially at the end  Though my general feeling is this is too long  over 2 hours and 40 minutes  and containing too much dialogs  And nearly no dancing at all  Clearly a Bollywood movie like Lagaan or Devdas is quite a different kind of movie compared with Chokher Bali
