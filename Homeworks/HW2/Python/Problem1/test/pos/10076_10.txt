I LOVED this movie  You can't buy it  rent it  or find it    but it's a keeper  Wonderful chemistry between Braccho and Walken    and Ferrar     Terrific non stop action and reactions     loved it  I've watched my pirated copy maybe 6 times in the last decade    each time showing it to someone who never heard of it  Find this movie and watch it   So many films are on TV over and over again - without any of the wit and style of this little film  I didn't know it was made for TV    my copy is an 8 track I pirated years ago    I hope it lasts
