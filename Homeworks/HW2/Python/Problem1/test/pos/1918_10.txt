well-made documentary about a sailing race  sanity and the loss of both  i remembered reading Sir Francis Chichester's account of his trip around the world when i was in high school as i watched this film  what an adventure that was   deep water tells an equally fascinating story   it takes a special person and an excellent sailor to manage a non-stop trip around the world   alone  this film does a great job of demonstrating that  i love to sail  and my brother races J-30s  but i could never accomplish such a feat
