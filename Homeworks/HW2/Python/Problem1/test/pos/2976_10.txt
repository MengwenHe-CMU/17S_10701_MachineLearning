I saw this movie when it was first released and thoroughly enjoyed it  What a movie  I am in my 40s now and have 2 teenage kids and I would like them to see this movie  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a romance movie or older Elton John music  I have searched most of the stores that sell both new and old movies but have not come across any  I bought some old movies like   Melody  in Hong Kong  who had quite a collection of old movie  but they did not have this   I am also looking at the sequel  Paul   Michelle  Can anyone please tell me how to get a copy of the VHS or DVD or VCD  Really appreciate it  Many Thanks
