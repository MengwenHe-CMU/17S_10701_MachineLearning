Clive Barker of Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and exciting  The make-up done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic  It took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground  It was really a treat to see the quality of work  It wasn't particularly horrible  as the worst creature was actually a human serial killer  I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also  Nothing spectacular  but fair  This was only Anne Bobby's third film  and she was good also  The ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts  as did David Cronenberg  Ha
