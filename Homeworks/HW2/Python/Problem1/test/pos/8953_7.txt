This was the film that started that the cinematic love affair between the Jaundiced Eye crew and Matthew Ferguson  His ability to portray RELATIVELY normal characters like Birkoff in  La Femme Nikita  is counter-balanced by his equally deft handling of weirdos like  Kane   One wishes that he would only be given more roles  bigger roles  and other  even more complex roles to assay to push the limits of his abilities  There were four or five memorable scenes in this film  and Matthew Ferguson stole two of them from far more experienced actors  This film itself is good  and it is worth watching on its own merits  but Ferguson makes it a little extra special  His  ouevre  may eventually show what the career of Anthony Perkins MIGHT have been like if he hadn't been typecast as  Norman Bates  so long ago   Kane  isn't quite as whacked-out as Norman  and far fewer people saw  Love and Human Remains than saw  Psycho   so we can hope that Ferguson will show us some hint of what Perkins MIGHT have been able to accomplish  had he been allowed to do so
