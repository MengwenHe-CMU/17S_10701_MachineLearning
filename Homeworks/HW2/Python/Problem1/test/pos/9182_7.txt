Will Smith is perfectly endearing as the  Relationship Doctor   here to heal all your relationship woes  I expected this to be a standard RomCom with little to amuse  I'm happy to report that I was wrong  Will Smith is delightful and unexpectedly  fresh  in this Andy Tennant vehicle  Surrounded by a great supporting cast  an interesting story  and fed with witty dialog  I was thoroughly engaged  We found this one cute  quirky  and inspirational without being preachy  It rates a 7 4 10 from    the Fiend
