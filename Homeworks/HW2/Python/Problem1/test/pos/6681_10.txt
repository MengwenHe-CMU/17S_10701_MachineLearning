If you have enjoyed the Butterfly Effect  Donnie Darko or The Machinist  you will enjoy K-Pax too  To me  this movie felt really uplifting and yet depressing in the end  Spacey delivers a great performance as Prot  Also  lets not forget the appearance of Saul Williams in the movie  who i am a big fan of  After watching it  i recommended the movie to lots of my friends  and everyone was pretty much blown away  But still  it is very underrated  maybe because of the lack of action and explosions  I'm sorry  this is not a movie about blowing things up  it's about how humans behave  and how people live in worlds that don't exist  Go on  and enjoy
