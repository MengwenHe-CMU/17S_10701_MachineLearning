Wrestlemania 6  is an entertaining Wrestlemania  if not an entirely successful one  The Ultimate Challenge  is of course worth the price of admission alone  but once again as with a lot of the early Mania's  there's too much filler in between  The crowd pops for almost everything  and as always  giving us the reliable announcing team of Gorilla The Body  Having a Face vs Face match as the main event for a Wrestlemania  was absolutely unheard of at this time  it only made things that much more tense   Matches   Koko B  Ware W Frankie Vs  The Model  Rick Martel  For a 3 or so minute match  this is as good as it gets  I wish it was a tad longer  but what I got  was pretty damn good  Martel wins  with the Boston Crab  2 1 2  5 WWF Tag Team Championship  Demolition Vs Colossal Connection C  W Bobby Heean  HUGE Pop for Demolition  Match itself is pretty dull  I often had trouble paying attention  Andre really didn't do much  so in a way it was more like a 2 on 1  There is solid talent involved here  and it's a shame they couldn't produce better  Demolition wins that titles  with there Pattened maneuver off the top  Crowd blows the roof of for the finish  1 1 2  5 Earthquake W Jimmy Hart  Vs Hercules I got what I expected here  a standard boring filler match  with Earthquake doing his thing  I'm not really a fan of either  so It didn't perk my interest much  Quake wins with his sit down splash  1 5 Brutus Beefcake Vs Mr Pefect W The Genius  Deafening pop for Bruti  Really good match up  with sadly not enough time given to develop even further  It really kept my interest  and remains one of my favorites on the card  Beefcake wins with a slingshot to the post  much to the crowd's approval  3 5 Roddy Piper Vs Bad News Brown  HUGE pop for Piper  Nothing more than a boring brawl  that does not know what it wants to be  Some entertaining antics from The Hot Rod  but nothing else  Noteworthy for Roddy painting himself half black  and calling himself  Hot Scott  1 5 The Hart Foundation Vs The Bolsheviks  Record breaking  but other than that  nothing to see here  Harts win with  The Hart Attack  0 5 The Barbarian W Bobby Heenan  Vs Tito Santana  Average for the time it got  but watchable nonetheless  Crowd was rather dead for it  except for Heenan's interference  Jessie's hilarious cracks  about Tito's food is more entertaining  then the match itself  Barbarian wins with a nasty looking  flying clothesline off the top  2 5 Mixed Tag Match  Dusty Sapphire W Elizabeth  Vs Macho King Sherri  Big pop for Dusty  and an even bigger one for Elizabeth  who looks absolutely stunning  might I add  I thought it was OK  It was lively at least  if nothing that great  I'm not a fan of Dusty' so  Dusty and Sapphire win  when She rolls up Sherri  2 5 The Orient Express W Fuji  Vs The Rockers  Crowd is rather anemic for this  surprisingly  Decent no doubt  but with these guys involved  it should have been better  The constant focus with Fuji  kinda detracts from the match  Express wins by count out  when Janetty gets nailed with salt  2 1 2  5 Jim Duggan Vs Dino Bravo W Earthquake Jimmy Hart  Duggan like an idiot  brings out The American flag in Canada  Duggan gets some solid boo's for it too  but that also may be due to Bravo's Canadian heritage  Crappy match all around  I don't care for Duggan  but that's not why it sucked  Too short in the end  to really matter  Duggan wins when he whacks Bravo in the back  with the two by four  Duggan gets splashed for his troubles  0 5 Million Dollar Championship  Ted Dibiase C  W Virgil  Vs Jake Robers W Damien  Some slow spots  but when all was said and done  I had a good time  Two solid wrestlers giving it there all  resulted in an entertaining match up  Crowd noticeably gets Ancy during parts of it though  by doing the wave  Dibiase wins by count out  Jake has the last laugh  by giving away some of his money  much to the crowd's delight  3 5 Big Bossman Vs Akeem W Slick  Nice pop for The Bossman  Too routine  and too short to really mean anything  in the end  Akeem was a gimmick  I was never too fond of  Bossman wins with his slam  0 5 The Rhythm Blues segment was pretty much a failure  Crowd wasn't into it Rick Rude W Bobby Heenan  Vs Jimmy Snuka  For a filler match  before the main event  this wasn't too bad  If it had time to get going more  it would have been excellent  for sure  Rude wins  with the Rude Awakening  2 5 Title For Title  Ultimate Warrior IC Champ  Vs Hulk Hogan WWF Champ  This one is all about the atmosphere from the crowd  and the split crowd reaction  for the most part  Warrior got a pretty decent pop  but in my opinion it was a little underwhelming  Hogan dwarfs it completely with his  It's one of Wrestlemania's best matches in history  With two people  who aren't really known for there wrestling  they managed to create an amazing match up that was talked about for ages  I have seen this many times  and my respect level grows higher for each one  for their effort  considering i'm not a fan of either  Even die-hard fanatics who crave pure wrestling  can't bitch about this one   Warrior wins with his splash   5 5 Bottom line  Wrestlemania 6 is an entertaining entry  if nothing overly special  It's memorable for the main event  the location  and the crowd  but it's not one of the best if you ask me  That being said I do enjoy it  and I give it my recommendation to fellow wrestling fans  7 10
