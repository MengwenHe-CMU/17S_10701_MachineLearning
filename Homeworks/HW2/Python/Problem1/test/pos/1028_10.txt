    Great News there is a BBC DVD release scheduled for 31st July 2006 UK - there is also a scheduled release in States - don't know the date - can't wait               below is my original comment       I agree with all the other reviewers - it is simply staggering that one of the greatest TV dramas ever has never been released on DVD The story line is gripping - the acting is outstanding and the character development is enthralling   Over here in the UK we have quite a history of getting TV drama series and films out onto DVD through popular campaigns  It's very hard to see why the rights owners do not go into a DVD production   I'm going to e mail one of the leading players in this grass roots movement and see what happens  Who did the production   was it BBC   RW
