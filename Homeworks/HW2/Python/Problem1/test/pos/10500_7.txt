Thank you The FilmZone for showing this sleazy soft core sex flick at 1 a m  I truly enjoyed it  To be honest  I expected a lot more from a sexy cast with McKayla  Dru Berrymore  and of course  the talented Chloe Nicholle  as Rebecca Carter   The production values are truly bad mainly because of the low budget but a little more effort wouldn't harm  For example  the cinematography makes it look like a hard core porno movie  There's absolutely no effort in lightning  But let's ignore that fact because let's be honest  we watched  Pleasures of Sin  because of the high amounts of sex  The sex factor is pretty good and offers steamy  explicit scenes  Chole Nicholle delivers the best performance of the female cast  So my advice is   watch this movie if you are in the mood for good explicit sex or just watch it if you are a fan of Mrs  Nicholle  Recommended only for the sex scenes  don't expect anything else
