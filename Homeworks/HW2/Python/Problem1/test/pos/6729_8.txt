I remember watching this as a child as part of the Children s Film Foundations Friday Film Specials on CBBC and have recently happened upon a copy  In the twenty or so years since my last viewing this film has lost nothing  It is an atmospheric tale which entices with Cornish folklore and adds elements of truly creepy imagery of the ghost of the young miner Billy  Shot in the wonderfully scenic Port Loe area of Cornwall the film utilises the mixture of rugged coastline and abandoned tin mines to make the setting truly believable  There is much packed into this CFF drama  something long since lost from Children's television today and well worth a look if you can track down a copy
