I seriously enjoy Dr Who  Seriously  don't just dismiss me as a  sci-fi person   because I'm not normally  I caught on because a friend got me hooked when they started watching it  It is actually really funny  and more often than not  it's fast-paced  All of my family watch it pretty much and that's a miracle  Christopher Ecclestion is pretty good  but David Tennant is brilliant  I think it's because he made the Doctor so manic and it's just nice to have that little bit of eccentricity in a TV character again  I don't know what it is about it  but everything manages to work like clockwork   All I'm going to say is just try it  One episode  probably best if you don't pick the second half of a two-parter  though
