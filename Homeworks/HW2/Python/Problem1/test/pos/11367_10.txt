It was so very long ago  1960   but I have never forgotten this series and often wished it would reappear  So taken with it  I corresponded with Mr  Rathbun  then president of Standard Oil  which sponsored the presentation on PBS  He sent me a photo of the tapestry  actually a charcoal rendering  used behind the credits  To the opening theme music of Bayco's  Elizabethan Masque   my family and I gathered around our black   white TV to drink in Shakespeare's words as spoken by a group of excellent but relatively unknown players  at least to American audiences at the time   We were introduced to such actors as Sean Connery  Dame Judi Dench  Tom Fleming  Patrick Garland  Julian Glover and Robert Hardy  I have continued to enjoy their accomplishments ever since  One of the most interesting things was the way in which the actors continued to age in their respective roles as Shakespeare's  King  plays were presented  perhaps for the first time  in chronological order  I wish I could tell those actors just how much that series meant to me  If  Age of Kings  could be revived on VHS and or DVD  it would so please those of us who long to see it again and those who missed it the first time around  GOOD NEWS  PBS HAS JUST ISSUED A DVD OF  AN AGE OF KINGS   SEE THEIR JULY 2009 CATALOG  PAGE 19  OR CALL THEM TOLL FREE  I JUST ORDERED MINE
