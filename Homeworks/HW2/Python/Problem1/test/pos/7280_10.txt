The first thing I noticed about this movie was how well everything was set up  A quality movie all round   I suppose you could love this film just for its action  but I liked it for more than that  This is a pure thriller horror movie  It offers a more fully-fleshed script than most horror films do  I thought  at least the U S  version  ended brilliantly  and was great throughout  The story felt honest and brutal  The film has an excellent  tight script that keeps the action moving  with believable characters in largely believable situations
