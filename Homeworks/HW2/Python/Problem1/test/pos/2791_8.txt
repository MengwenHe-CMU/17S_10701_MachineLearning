I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say  french culture   I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendy's brother  Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as well  Favorite Part  When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce      My french isn't that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on   WATCH IT
