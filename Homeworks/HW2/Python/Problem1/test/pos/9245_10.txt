Nice doco Stuie   Even though it didn't work out how you wanted with the original film you have a fantastic piece of work and great viewing  It is self evident how much you put into it  That goes for everyone else too  It's great to see the warts and all account of the process without being 'too nice'  Loved it  Well worth a view  Que pena  the writer of 'the original' film couldn't appreciate what you have achieved  Love the attitude too  Great piece  Looking forward to seeing the next work  Keep going bro  Paully
