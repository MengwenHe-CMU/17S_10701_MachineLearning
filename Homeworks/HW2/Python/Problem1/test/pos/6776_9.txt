This is  by far  the best movie I've seen in a long while  It is a wholly original and beautiful plot  It is not boring  nor is it too dramatic  The characters are tangible and realistic  but it does not take away from the story line  The fact that is not in English is most likely the final touch  The end leaves you fulfilled in a way I've never experienced in a movie before   I wish I had found this movie earlier  More lines  more lines  more lines a lot more lines c'mon  i'm done
