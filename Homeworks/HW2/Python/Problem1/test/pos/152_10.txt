After watching Oldboy I was a little disappointed by the rest of Park's work  some of it is good but it never approaches the level of humour and originality that Oldboy had  This one does  it is nothing like Oldboy in plot or style but the same level of quality is there  The acting is good with Kang-ho Song  OK-bin Kim and Ha-kyun Shin delivering excellent performances  Kim in particular manages to swap from the creepy horror scenes to the surreal comedy without the slightest misstep  The plot is strange with lots of twists and turns and takes a big swipe at the vampire clich  s  The directing is spot on with tons of pace and humour throughout and some of the most memorable scenes I have ever seen  It does boast what is probably the weirdest love scene you will ever see  This is just a great film
