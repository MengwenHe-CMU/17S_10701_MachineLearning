This movie I've seen many times  I read the book   Englar Alheimsins which was written by Einar M  r Gu  mundsson who received the Scandinavian book awards for the work  The movie does not start on the same place as the book starts  It happens in Reykjav  k and the main character  P  ll is young and having a good life with his girlfriend  But as she breaks up the relationship with him  he starts to get some headaches which make him annoyed and angry  And soon he starts to have big mental problems and then the movie begins  Soon he is puted in the Icelandic Mental Hospital called  Kleppur  and there you get to see some great characters like Viktor who thinks he is Hitler and   li who thinks that he writes all the   The Beatles  songs and sends them to them with mind transporting  Ingvar E Sigur  usson who has the role of the main character P  ll does is so work so well that it leaves you breathless  Also the music in this movie is mad by SIGURR  S and just for the music's cost you should see the movie  Overall a great movie meant to be seen
