i am finally seeing the El Padrino movie  from what I can see it is an incredible film  and lots of action Damian Chapa is good director  But I must admit I love his acting the Best  Also I saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga  she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit  However the film El Padrino is a pure 10 action epic  Why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is  I am so happy to see someone I know to be a real great actor become a great director also  I am one of those people who love to see artists make it  B S
