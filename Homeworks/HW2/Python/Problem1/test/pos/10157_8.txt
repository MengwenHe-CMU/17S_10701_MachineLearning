James Stewart plays Dr  Ben McKenna  who  with his wife and son  are tourists in an Arabian city  They get caught up in the middle of a murder scene  The victim whispers something in Dr  McKenna's ear  and he is told to do something  Later  his son is kidnapped  The kidnappers turn out to be a man and woman he knew  but the woman is a bit softer than the man  The song   Que  Sera  Sera   Whatever we'll be  we'll be   is one of the best songs ever sung in any movie  Doris Day play's Stewart's wife  and she sings the song mentioned above  Her performance is Oscar worthy  I'm surprised she wasn't even nominated  My Score  8 10
