I loved it  In fact  I watched it over and over and over  and I could watch it again  This movie doesn't get boring  The vampire concept is revolutionized in this movie  It's a job well done  great for today's generation  Wesley Snipes was born for this role  Stephen Dorff was an ideal vampire  Arly Jover  mmmm mmm  she can bite me any time she wants and what a sexy accent she has  Donal Logue provides great comical relief  This vampire movie is like no other  I can't wait for Blade 2
