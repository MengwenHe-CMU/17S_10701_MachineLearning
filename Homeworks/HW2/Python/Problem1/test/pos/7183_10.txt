Eh oui  impossible n'est pas gaulois  Well paced  highly entertaining film  Pretty good command of the French language and knowledge of modern France  and history  are recommended  I don't think this film really works in any other language  The film is incredibly much better than the previous one  In search of      Apart from great actors and savvy camera handling it's the wit and firework of allusions  word plays etc  that make for a really great movie  The cartoon vorlage is recognizable but the film is very emancipated  The cost of the film is put to good use  Indeed  all the special effects fit 'naturally' into the movie  you never feel choked by them  Bref  oui  les 2CVs    a tra  ne un peu mais    part cela  Imhotep  -A neighbour from the other side of the Rhine
