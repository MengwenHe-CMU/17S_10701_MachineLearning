  SPOILERS AHEAD   It is really unfortunate that a movie so well produced turns out to be such a disappointment  I thought this was full of  silly  clich  s and that it basically tried to hard   To the  American  guys out there  how many of you spend your time jumping on your girlfriend's bed and making monkey sounds  To the  married  girls  how many of you have suddenly gone from prudes to nymphos overnight--but not with your husband  To the French  would you really ask about someone being     la fac  when you know they don't speak French  Wouldn't you use a more common word like  universit      I lived in France for a while and I sort of do know and understand Europe  and I love it   but my  German  roommate and I found this pretty insulting overall  It looked like a movie funded by the European Parliament  and it tried too hard basically  It had all sorts of differences that it tried to tie together  not a bad thing in itself  but the result is at best awkward  but in fact ridiculous--too many clashes that wouldn't really happen  Then the end of the movie--the last 10 minutes--ruined all the rest  Why doesn't Xavier talk to the Erasmus students he meets back in Paris  Why does he just walk off  Why does he just run away from his job  is that  freedom   And in the end  is the new Europe supposed to rest on a bunch of people who smoke up and shag all day  Is this what it's made up of   Besides  the acting was pretty horrible  I can't believe Judith Godr  che's role and acting  Why was she made to look like Emanuelle B  art so much  At first I thought Xavier was OK but with retrospect I think he was pretty bad   And that's all really too bad  because technically  opening credits  scenes when he's asking what papers he needs  it was really good  except for sound editing around the British siblings   and the soundtrack was great too  So the form was good  but the content pretty horrible
