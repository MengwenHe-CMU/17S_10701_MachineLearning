Finally a gangster Movie worth watching  Jennifer Tily should get nominated for her role as tough murdering femme fatal  This Movie flies like a bird   just a fast paced non stop Gangster Mayhem  Jennifer Tily is just so beautiful and bad in this Movie  I was shocked to find Faye Dunaway still lives  The cast in this movie are so fitted to their roles   A real cool soundtrack rides along side and you get swept into the Spanish soul of this film  The story is original deep and poetic  This Flick has a lot of Substance and never rests  The gang of Spanish Fire just set everything on screen alight  Damian Chapa Is a Joy to watch and a Movie Star  Sit back and enjoy the ride
