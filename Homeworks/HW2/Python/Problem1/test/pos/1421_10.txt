WARNING  MAY contain some minor spoilers  Hard to say anything bad about this movie  except for one thing  YOU DON'T GET TO SEE IT MUCH ANYMORE      Then again  maybe that's because you have to be home in the morning or at 3 am to catch it the Fox Movie channel  Too bad  for this is another gem lost to time  Clifton Webb takes his patented sour  know-it-all demeanor he had perfected as Lynn Belvedere   Sitting Pretty  and sequels   and turns 'Nature Boy'  Actually  it's like this  Webb plays Robert Jordan the host of a Sunday children's educational program that is losing audience share  and the network breaks it to him that he needs to do something about it  or else  Part of the problem may be due to the fact that the married host has no children  BUMMER     But as such things happen  the local church pastor needs a leader for an unruly troop of Boy Scouts  and finds a willing victim     ahhhh 'VOLUNTEER'     in the host  so Jordan he takes the position  Problem solved  RIGHT     WRONG     This being a movie there are other problems  For example  it turns out one of the Scouts is the son of his boss at the TV station  which causes a little friction  especially since the kid is overweight  has asthma as well as an attitude  And he is the more reasonable one  Also  there is this Cub Scout  Mike  George Winslow  who wants to hang around  being the 'stray puppy' type  As it turns out  the reason is that he has no folks of his own  but is cared for by a relative who hasn't much time for him  It is things like this that makes his job harder than expected   All in all  Webb becomes more understanding of kids  and not only saves his show but learns a rewarding lesson  and eventually even adopts Mike  Still a great movie after all these years
