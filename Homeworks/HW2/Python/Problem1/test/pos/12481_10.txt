One of the best film I ever saw  The performance of Louis Jouvet is fantastic  He really 'fill' his part  and this is wonderful  He's such a good actor that you can't think of anyone else to take his part   And both Suzy Delair and Bernard Blier are good as standard french people  trying to defend themselves in the struggle born with a murder    The story is breathtaking and well built  You can feel the ambiance of Paris for that period  which is about 1930-40   between two wars    The clubs  the old little buildings  the neighbors  All those things contribute to make a great movie
