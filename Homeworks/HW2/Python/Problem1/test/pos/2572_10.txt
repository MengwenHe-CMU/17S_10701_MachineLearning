I suppose this is what is called Southern Gothic  It stars Samuel L  Jackson  Christina Ricci  and also Justin Timberlake is featured in a role  Timberlake does good work  much to my surprise  I didn't expect it of him  When you're lost and you can't find your way home--that's the black snake moan  The people in this movie are definitely lost in many ways  psychologically and emotionally damaged  betrayed by those they trusted and loved and filled with a lot of pain  Samuel L  Jackson plays a blues singer musician--whose wife has messed around with his brother and now left him for his brother  along with aborting a child he had hoped to have with her  Christina Ricci's character is a woman who was sexually abused when young--this has turned her into a self destructive nymphomaniac  allowing men to treat her badly  The story lies in the intersection of these two characters lives  It is a love story  but not a sexual love story  between them--the older black man and the young white woman  It is different from most films Hollywood grinds out  I highly recommend it  10 stars
